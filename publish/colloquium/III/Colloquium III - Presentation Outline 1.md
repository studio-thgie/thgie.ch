# Colloquium III - Outline
- Intro ~2min
	- Kurzer Auffrischer
	- Relevance and Social Relevance of Voice Assistant Technology
	- Research Plan, Timeline and Budget
- Brief Review of Research done until C2 ~2min
	- Looking at aspects of entertainment and home automation
		- What Role does VA play in peoples lifes, what is their relationship to it
		- Interviews, Observation and TA
	- Verdict:
		- interesting questions around the negotiation of privacy
		- personally think VAs are unnecessary
- The big question in the feedback was about the (social) relevance
- Relevance of Engagement with Voice Assistant Technologies ~4min
	- Tech is here to stay -> Numbers
		- Right now as well as development into the near future
		- Range of devices and services
	- Many problems
		- Biases in algorithms
			- Behind the power of VAs is machine learning a subbranch of AI where the algos are trained with lots of material
		- Patriarchial  design of assistant
		- Ecology -> Numbers; this was also the part that inspired me to engage with the tech
		- UX is less then perfect, see my own research
- Social Relevance of Voice Assistant ~6min

	- Privacy being one of the main obstacles for better adoption
	- -> research question focus

- Research plan ~5min
	- Methodology
		- Interviews, Observations
		- Iterative Workshops -> Prototyping
	- Timeline and Budget
