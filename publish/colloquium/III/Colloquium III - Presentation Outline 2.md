# Colloquium III - Outline
- Intro
	- Changes in research approach and focus
	- Research Plan
- Changes
	- want to address the changes since c2, especially the transformation of the underlying research approach
	- until c2 i looked at electronics from an ecological perspective, intending to change the way we relate, respect and care for such devices
	- rooted in own experience and work and driven by a desire to do better within my own professionality
	- based on that i developed an interest in animism as a way of relating to things
	- and after a moment or two i choose voice assistants as the object of study to test this approach upon
	- until c2 the focus was very much within the context of entertainment and home automation where i also made most of my ethnographic research
- The big question in the feedback was about the (social) relevance
	- in terms of relevance of studying voice assistants and regarding the possible forms of engagements and output
	- already before c2 i was playing with the thought of looking into therapeutic applications of voice assistants to address the social relevance part
	- an idea i didn't pursue after having a talk with a person from the BFH Medical Informatics. he very much advise against such a thing. he said it's not a fun market to enter on your own right now
	- i picked up the idea after c2 again but under the aspect of assistive devices
	- this initiative was sparked partially by my engagement with ontological design as well as post-phenomenology 
- next to a new round of literature review in terms of design and inclusion i also made a couple of additional Interviews with focus on how voiceassistants mediate our access to the world, especially for people with disabilities

	- [folie] an aquintance wo has partial tetraplegia after an accident and is dependent on voice-assistive technologies
	- [folie] a former Superflux designer who has a very critical approach to voice assistants in his project 
- out of this process I was able to reformulate the research approach and focus and i'm very happy with it like this
- Research plan
	- sketch for the research proposal, with points taken from the snf guide
	- 2.1 Current state of research in the research area
		- [slide] ven diagram intersection
		- Human-computer interaction studies
			- User-Experience und -Interaction Design
			- Conversation Design
		- Disability studies und inclusive design
			- Ontological design
		-  which previous findings are the starting point and basis for the planned investigations
	- good amount of research, often with an empiric approach and rooted in medical technology and information technology
	- would love to make the link to a more design based approach
		- next to the discourse in design justice which needs to be considered there is also a discourse specifically on design and disability, ie
		- Inklusion als Entwurf, Tom Bieling
		- goes hand in hand with the theoretical approach that I'm suggesting
		- [zusammenfassung buch abstrakt]
		- what important, relevant research is currently underway in Switzerland and abroad
			-  VA-People, Experiences, Practices, Routines (VA-PEPR)
			-  [zusammenfassung abstrakt]
			-  Use of voice assistants with voice-activated and voice-enabled devices in healthcare
			-  [zusammenfassung abstrakt]
		- where and why is there a need for research
			- gap inbetween medical tech and it and UX understood as the design of grafical UIs
			- Meanwhile, I am much more interested in the ontological dimension of voice assistants as assitive devices.
			-  [slide] ven diagram gap
	- 2.2 Status of own research
- my research shows that manufacturers have a limited view on user experience and that an expension of ontological design can be helpful. i base this hypothesis on my ethnographic research with vas within the context of entertainment
- Reference of a position; ontological design, post-phenomenology
- worked out a process of deep reading user experience that can be analysed within a postphenomenological approach regarding design questions
- additional to the design perspective i have a quite extensive knowledge and skill in terms of the underlying technologies which is a very valuable assets and brings with it a unique perspective
	- 2.3 Objectives, data and methods
		- 2.3.1 Forschungsfrage
			- How must voice assistants and the interaction with them be designed so that these technologies become a disability-first interface for people with visual or mobility impairments?
			- How must voice assistants be designed so that people with disabilities can actively shape their lives with their help? 
		- 2.3.2 Hypotheses and assumptions
- Voice assistant technologies up to date are primarily a workaround to make lifeworlds, content or processes designed for able-bodied and neuro typical people accessible to people with disabilities.
- my hypothesis then is, that VAs have what they need to be a first-class interface for people with disabilities
- I bespoke such a hypothesis with the head of tech projects at the SBV and he agreed with me from a position of personal experience and professionall expertise
		- 2.3.4 Concrete objectives
- In addition to the scientific analysis and publication, the materialised output should be a digital guide for designing voice assistants or functionalities for people with disabilities. 
- low-threshold access guide for interested parties, especially for designers and institutions that are active in this field
- the guide will include tutorials and technological fragments, like code examples and blueprints and be published under an opensource license
- as such, the guide can be built upon in practice as well as in further research projects
	- 2.4 Timetable and milestones
		- Phase 1 - Literature study; 6 months
		- Phase 2 - Qualitative evaluation and needs analysis; 6 months
		- Phase 3 - Workshop series / focus group / prototyping; 12 months
		- Phase 4 - Evaluation and finalisation; 6 months
		- Phase 5 - Publication; 6 months
		- I'm not quite sure about the length of the first two phases, but i guess we can talk about that in q&a
	- 2.5 Relevance of the research work
- Scientific relevance
	- focus on essential knowledge for design discourse on disabilities as well as human computer interaction
	- adding depth to the discourse on user-experience design
- Social relevace
	- focus on essential knowledge on the design and development of assistive voice assistants which can be used in political or activist projects as well design studios
	- representational character for disability discourses in design and human-computer interaction
	- curb effect
- Budget and Funding Possibilities
- budget as suggested according to doc.ch, but as I don't think i'll be funded through that scheme, given my age and unacademic career, I also thought about alternatives
- Alternative PhD Programms: Make Sense PhD Program (https://makesensephd.ch/#/project?id=8)
- Get fragments of the projects funded or supported
	- through tech-Partners: SBV, caru-care
	- call for projects or maybe even a residency

- Q&A
- current situation; 60% - 70%
- could you give me any recommendation in terms of pre-study formats and fundings or other ways of furthering this project
- what kind of funding formats for the whole enterprise or parts of it could you recommend besides the provided, residencies, php programs, partial project funding
- applied methodology, since I missed a large part of the design research course, I sometimes have the feeling that I'm missing something here, but not exactly what. Could you tell me if you think it's feasable or can you give me few hooks that I definitly shoudl follow up until the thesis?
- machen 3 jahre sinn oder soll ich besser auf 4 ausweiten
- do you have the feeling that the part on participatory workshops need to be fleshed out a bit more?
