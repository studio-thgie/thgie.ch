## Business Case
> 05	OBJECTIVES – Describe the problem to be solved, shortcomings of existing solutions/competitors and the business opportunity (market/customers) you want to pursue. What is the project’s value proposition? Give concrete examples, names and numbers.

I believe that there is untapped potential in voice assistant technology. I also believe that the current state of consumer technology hinders us from accessing this potential. This project's research points to two underlying problems; Closed source technologies prevent trusting them and a patronizing user experience disenfranchises the user.

This project proposes to radically rethink the interaction we have with technology and enable a internet of things ecosystem the users can trust. The goal is the development and testing of a prototype for a voice assistant for sensitive contexts and applications, like therapy settings and elderly care, by respecting privacy and giving control back to the user.

Current business models behind voice assistants favor the tracking of user data in order to refine advertisement strategies as well as produce maps of desire. These maps record and predict how, where and when customers shop and consume. As voice assistants are often brought into the innermost sanctum of privacy, the family and the home, the needs of the user and the intentions of the manufacturers are diametralic opposites.

This is the first problem that needs to be solved. Technologies that enter privacy-sensitive spaces, like our homes or therapy settings, need to be based on radical openness and transparent approaches.

At best, concerns over privacy concentrate on the legal-juridical and technical aspects. From a holistic interaction and user experience design perspective trust is not something that can be earned by ticking off a terms and conditions page while on-boarding a service. Trust is earned through a practice of negotiating privacy, intimacy and consent. This acts of negotiating are embodied practices. When we communicate with another person we don't just exchange words. When we engage each other we add gesture and mimic, eye contact and body posture. These cues help in transporting information and meaning.

This second issue goes hand in hand with an open approach to the underlying technologies. Based on research done in this project, the user would welcome to have more control to fine tune their interaction and communication with the voice assistant. This projects proposes adding layers of interaction through a thing-based design approach. Additional sensors, gesture recognition, beacon objects as well as an alternative to assistant persona design would re-enable the possibilities to negotiate issues of privacy and intimacy, while also being conceived as an open system that can learn from the user or be customized by them.

Imagine an Amazon Echo, but fully owned by you - even the data collected - and with an interaction design and user experience that holistically incorporates you as a person. Such an approach could enable the usage of voice assistant technology in privacy-sensitive context.

> 07	STATE OF THE ART – What is the applied research base of your business project? Have you achieved the proof of concept in your Bachelor/Master thesis? What is your expertise brought to the project? 

The research body was build through classical ethnography, mainly observation and interviews. On top of that more recent netnography was applied, which was ethnographic research done online mainly to capture user experience reports. Besides that, the capturing of user journeys, coming from design research, was very important to paint a picture of the pain points.

To work with the data I opted for a thematic analysis, with a reflexive approach after Braun and Clarke. This is a rather classic qualitative data analysis approach for mixed media datasets that labels the transcribed data and then builds overarching themes out of the codes.

The last step of the research process, before going into prototyping, was an expert workshop. I wanted to to have the opinion of specialists in their respective design disciplines on how to improve the emotional bond between users and their voice assistant devices. The workshop was based on the emotional durable design framework, by Jonathan Chapman, as well as the thematic analysis.

Before to doing a Masters in Design Research at the HKB in Bern, I studied Industrial Design in Basel. I have a working experience of more the 15 years as software developer, from freelancing to senior developer. Right now I'm engaged in a 4-year research project at the University of Basel as a scientific software programmer. I had a critical engagement with technology and society since at least since 2014 where I initiated the ckster festival on contemporary hacking practices. I was able to share my love for technology in many workshops, among other at the ZHdK, the FHNW or privately organized.

> 08	BUSINESS MODEL – Who will buy what, to which price and why? Describe your revenue stream and how it will sustainably finance the business activities after the end of the funding period? 

I see three possibilities for revenue streams.

Voice assistant as a service would be a consulting enterprise which, next to the development, helps implement voice assistant technologies in privacy-sensitive projects. It would, furthermore, help in conceptualizing and implementing research projects done with and through voice assistants, for example in the health sector.

Voice assistant as a research platform is a development kit which research institutions or projects could obtain on their own. The costs of the kit are lower but there is no service to be provided.

Voice assistant for the privacy-sensitive user is a spin-off that provides a polished experience of the device and it's services to people who want to benefit from such an approach. These are mostly private customers who would be able and wanting to pay a premium price for the added privacy and adaptability.

> 09	CUSTOMERS/PARTNERS – Indicate the main customers and partners of your business project. 

Setting off from the business model, this approach points to three customer strata.

- Private or academic research institution that are interested in doing research with voice assistant technologies in privacy-sensitive areas, like the BFH health institutes or the ZAHW psychology faculty.
- Private or academic teams that seek to incorporate voice assistant technology on their own.
- Privacy-seeking users of voice assistants.

> 10	MARKET ENTRY STRATEGY – How do you intend to attract and acquire your first customers? Describe your scale-up strategy. 

The first customers would probably not bring any revenue but help built an applied projects portfolio. I can imagine, that we would get smaller research projects or even students projects that want to work with voice assistant technology on board and help them in their research endeavors through mentoring and technical realization. That would open up academic and research institutions pathways and help establish a steady flow of income.

In a second phase this projects portfolio could expand to include other privacy-sensitive internet of things technologies, like proximity and tracking sensor for indoor tracking. An expansion of the portfolio, built on the same principles, would help expand the set of customers to other areas.

> 11	NOVELTY – To what extent is your project innovative and unique (USP)? 

The most important USP is the products focus on privacy and intimacy, which is not only tackled from a legal-juridical or technological perspective, but also from interaction design and user experience research. Instead of feeding your most private data into the tracking habits of big-tech companies, this product and all its data belongs to you. The interaction design with the product not only lets you know this, but also feel and experience it.

> 12	IMPACT – What lasting benefits to society is the project aiming to achieve when implemented? Give concrete examples. 

Internet of thing technologies contain immense potential. Voice assistants are wonderful computer interfaces, but we need to separate them from the data tracking practices and the imagination of the big tech companies. They cater first and foremost to clients with an interest in  gadgetry and consumer electronics. This projects seeks to do this step of separating concerns of interest and by that, opening up the potentials for further development. In the case of voice assistants there are two aspects which are especially valuable. As a handsfree and auditory interface, they provide computing access to people with mobility problems. As a device you talk too, voice assistants can be of supportive aid in therapeutic settings, for example as journaling tool.

> 14	DETAILED PROJECT BUDGET – Budget for the overall project, partial budget for the project submitted to Gebert Rüf Stiftung, contribution of your home institute, funding awarded or expected from third-party sources (specify sources).

For a detailed budget, please see the attached sheet. The listed costs are rough estimates for the prototyping phase of the project. There is no funding awarded yet or expected from third-parties other then my own contribution to the project. It is planned to seek further funding from foundations interested in privacy-sensitive enterprises like the Mozilla Foundation, Ledger, and similar.

> 15	DETAILED PROJECT BUDGET SUBMITTED TO GEBERT RÜF STIFTUNG –  How will you use the funds? Make a distinction between salaries (provide underlying cost system/structure) and material expenses.

The attached budget is what is submitted to Gebert Rüf. The funds will go mostly into salaries as the needed material are rather inexpensive.

> 21	COMMITMENT – What is your motivation brought to the project? 

I'm personally driven by the believe that we can and have to do better in terms of consumer technology. There is untapped or even wasted potential hidden in the piles of electronic waste; in terms of mitigation of environmental problems as well as what technologies could do for us as people and communities, or even the society at large. I’m dedicated to bring out this potential and make it available. I also believe that the tech industry's large players grew tired of trying to do their best, and that sustainable and healthy innovation needs to come from contextual and applied research.

I always wanted to use my unique skillset to the betterment of society by giving back what I learned and can do.

> 22	SKILL EXPANSION – Which topics would interest you to learn about?

I'm mainly interested in learning to develop interface technologies into applicable use cases that are actually needed. I do have the necessary base skills, especially regarding technology, but I would love to further hone and strengthen my skills in design research approaches and technical realizations. I would also love to learn and practice ethical business management, for example through steward ownership. I had my fair share of economics and project management throughout my life, but didn't had the chance to economically lead finance driven enterprises.
