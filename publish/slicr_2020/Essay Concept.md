# Essay Concept

In this essay I would love to reflect on the usage of language and the application of concepts in Anna Tsing's work. As she is quite free in her usage of terms and concepts to describe the results of her research, her approach need a deeper reflection.

How does the application of language and concepts in certain anthropological approaches reflect their research on indigenous epistemologies? Does it aid in making other worlds approachable? Is it inherently political or is it simply taking up the anthropological notion of talking in the language of the researched?

I would like to focus on her description of trees as an actor as they are thoroughly present in *Friction*[@tsingFrictionEthnographyGlobal2015] and *Mushroom at the End of the World*[@tsingMushroomEndWorld2015]. To aid in this analysis I will analyze Tania Li's use of trees [@liLandEndCapitalist2014] for comparison and extension as well as the theories described in “Animism” Revisited by Nurit Bird-David [@bird-davidAnimismRevisitedPersonhood2002]. Especially Bird-Davids notion of animism as a relational epistemology seems helpful in an analysis of Anna Tsings patchy writing. It will be interesting to see how the embedding of trees in Anna Tsing's story-making reflect a relational approach.
