# Trees with Tsing, Mushroom

Through their ability to nurture trees, matsutake help forests grow in
daunting places. s.4
#tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-tending

When forests in Japan
are allowed to grow back, without human disturbance, broadleaf trees
shade out pines, preventing their further germination. s.6
#tree/is-broadleaf #tree/is-pine #tree/as-multispecies

Fossil
fuel replaced firewood and charcoal; farmers no longer used the remain-
ing woodlands, which grew up in dense thickets of broadleaf trees. s.7

 In the gath-
ering dark, we scrambled up a rocky hillside not far from his camp. I
saw nothing but dirt and some scrawny pine trees. But here was Kao
with his bucket and stick, poking deep into clearly empty ground and
pulling up a fat button. s.14
#tree/is-pine #tree/as-cognition

 In the shifting culti-
vation I studied in Indonesian Borneo, many crops grew together in the
same field, and they had quite different schedules. Rice, bananas, taro,
sweet potatoes, sugarcane, palms, and fruit trees mingled; farmers
needed to attend to the varied schedules of maturation of each of these
crops. s.24
#tree/is-palm #tree/is-fruit #tree/is-farm

The important stuff
for life on earth happens in those transformations, not in the decision
trees of self-­contained individuals. Rather than seeing only the expansion-­
and-­conquest strategies of relentless individuals, we must look for histo-
ries that develop through contamination. s.29
#tree/as-bonmot

 It turned out that they could not
reproduce without the periodic fires the Forest Service had stopped. But
firs and spindly lodgepole pines were flourishing with fire exclusion—­at
least if flourishing means spreading in ever denser and more flammable
thickets of live, dead, and dying trees. s.30

Matsutake mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of an
underground fungus associated with certain forest trees.  The fungus
gets its carbohydrates from mutualistic relations with the roots of its
host trees, for whom it also forages.  Matsutake make it possible for host
trees to live in poor soils, without fertile humus. In turn, they are nour-
ished by the trees.  s.40
#tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-host #tree/as-home

Such management took a huge amount of work. Unwanted tree species,
and indeed all other species, were sprayed with poison. Fires were abso-
lutely excluded.  Alienated work crews planted “superior” trees. Thin-
ning was brutal, regular, and essential. Proper spacing allowed maxi-
mum rates of growth as well as mechanical harvesting. Timber trees
were a new kind of sugarcane: managed for uniform growth, without
multispecies interfere  s.41
#tree/as-labor #tree/as-anti-nature #tree/is-timber #tree/as-plantation #tree/as-industry

Earlier, timber companies had
made a killing by just harvesting the most expensive trees; when na-
tional forests were opened for logging after World War II, they contin-
ued “high grading,” ” a practice dignified under standards that said ma-
ture trees were better replaced by fast-­growing youngsters. s.41
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-goods

 But the regrowing trees of
scientific-­
 industrial management were not so inviting, profit-­
 wise. s.41
 #tree/as-investment #tree/as-economy
 
 Without easy pickings, timber companies began to search elsewhere for
cheaper trees.  s.41
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-economy

They were
blamed for the crashing timber economy, but the timber companies—­
and most of the big trees—­had already left.  s.42
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-economy

 And what is smell but a
particular form of chemical sensitivity? In this interpretation, trees too are touched by the smell of matsutake, allowing it into their roots. As
with truffles, flying insects have been seen circling underground caches. s.45
#tree/as-person #tree/as-multispecies

The Cage quotation with which I began this
chapter is his translation of seventeenth-­century Japanese poet Matsuo
Basho’s haiku, “matsutake ya shiranu ki no ha no hebari tsuku,” which
I have seen translated as “Matsutake; And on it stuck / The leaf of some
unknown tree.” s.46
#tree/as-aesthetic

 Now the hill was alternately dark
with planted conifers and choked with evergreen broadleaf trees, with
only a few dying pines. s.49
#tree/is-broadleaf #tree/is-pine #tree/is-conifer #tree/as-landscape

 All
over the world, indeed, matsutake are associated with the most disturbed
kinds of forests: places where glaciers, volcanoes, sand dunes—­or human
actions—­have done away with other trees and even organic soil. s.50
#tree/as-disturbance

Might it encounter the
roots of a receptive tree? A change in substrate or potential nutrition? s.50
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-actant

Humans matter on these land-
scapes. And humans (like fungi and trees) bring histories with them to
meet the challenges of the encounter. s.50
#tree/as-actant

Matsutake in Oregon associate with many host trees. Oregon pickers
can distinguish the host tree with which a particular matsutake has
grown—­partly from the size and shape, but partly from the smell. s.51
#tree/as-host 

Open Ticket is haunted by many ghosts: not only the “green” ghosts
of pickers who died untimely deaths; not only the Native American
communities removed by U.S. laws and armies; not only the stumps of
great trees cut down by reckless loggers, never to be replaced; not only
the haunting memories of war that will not seem to go away; but also
the ghostly appearance of forms of power s.76
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-believes

Good buyers know from
the feel. They can also smell the provenance of the mushroom: its host
tree; the region it comes from; other plants, such as rhododendron,
which affect the size and shape. s.81
#tree/as-host 

 They asked her where she found the mush-
rooms. “Under green trees.” Where were these green trees? “All trees are
green trees,” she insisted. Then she pulled out her cell phone and started
calling her supporters. s.93
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-political 

During Japan’s building boom in the 1970s and 1980s, Japanese im-
ported Indonesian trees to make plywood construction molds. But no
Japanese cut down Indonesian trees. s.113
#tree/is-indonesian

Fourth, supply-­chain
arrangements accommodated illegal logging as a layer of subcontract-
ing, which harvested trees protected by environmental regulations. s.114
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-goods

The cost could be calculated
without regard to the lives and livelihoods of loggers, trees, or forest
residents. s.114
#tree/as-economy #tree/as-abstract

 A timber company came and cut
down the forest. When the trees were gone, the company left, leaving a
pile of disintegrating machines. The residents could no longer make a
living either from the forest or from the company. s.131
#tree/as-absent #tree/as-sustenance #tree/as-goods

 Fungi also
digest wood. Otherwise, dead trees would stack up in the forest forever.
Fungi break them down into nutrients that can be recycled into new
life. s.138
#tree/as-host #tree/as-nature

They are so delicious, and so difficult for humans
to manipulate, because they thrive together with host trees. They come
into being only through interspecies relations. s.138
#tree/as-host #tree/as-multispecies

By leaning on fungal companions, trees grow strong and
numerous, making forests. s.139
#tree/as-multispecies

 In
a forest, fungi connect not just trees of the same species, but often many
species.  If you cover a tree in the forest, depriving its leaves of light and
thus food, its mycorrhizal associates may feed it from the carbohydrates
of other trees in the network.  s.139
#tree/as-multispecies

 If
you want matsutake in Japan, he explained, you must have pine, and if
you want pine, you must have human disturbance. He was supervising
work to remove broadleaf trees from the hillside he showed me. Even
the topsoil had been carted away, and the steep slope now looked
gouged and bare to my American eyes. s.151
#tree/is-pine #tree/is-broadleaf #tree/as-disturbance

“Call me Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. I’m a tiny, wormlike creature, a
nematode, and I spend most of my time crunching the insides of pine
trees. But my kin are as well-­traveled as any whaler sailing the seven
seas. Stick with me, and I’ll tell you about some curious voyages.” s.156
#tree/is-pine #tree/as-host #tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-deseased

Pine wilt nematodes are unable to move from tree to tree without the
help of pine sawyer beetles, who carry them without benefit to them-
selves.  s.156
#tree/is-pine #tree/as-deseased #tree/as-multispecies

When the beetles move to a new tree to lay their eggs, the nematodes slip
into the new tree’s wound. s.156
#tree/as-deseased #tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-host

 These nematodes became tree killers only when they
traveled to Asia, where pines were unprepared and vulnerable.  s.157
#tree/is-pine #tree/as-person

 Ever-
green broadleaf trees crowd and shade Japanese pine. Blue-­stain fungus
sometimes grows in pine’s wounds, feeding the nematodes. s.157
#tree/descriptive #tree/is-broadleaf #tree/is-pine #tree/as-deseased

Disturbance can renew ecologies as well as destroy them. How terrible
a disturbance is depends on many things, including scale. Some distur-
bances are small: a tree falls in the forest, creating a light gap. s.160
#tree/as-nature #tree/as-disturbance

Ecologists call
the effects that organisms create on their environments “ecosystems en-
gineering.” 18 A tree holds boulders in its roots that otherwise might be
swept away by a stream; an earthworm enriches the soil.  s.161
#tree/as-person #tree/as-nature #tree/as-infrastructure

 I was sur-
prised. I had thought of natural forests as packed with tall and tiny trees,
all jumbled together, of many species and ages. Here all the trees were
just the same: one species, one age, neat and evenly spaced. Even the
ground was clean and clear without a snag or a piece of downed wood.
It looked exactly like an industrial tree plantation.  s.167
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-aesthetic #tree/as-landscape #tree/as-anti-nature

 I asked
what a mess looked like, and they told me the trees were uneven and the
ground full of dead wood; no one cleared it up. s.167
#tree/as-anti-nature

The lines have blurred. A natural forest in northern Finland looks a
lot like an industrial tree plantation. The trees have become a modern
resource, e, and the way to manage a resource is to stop its autonomous
historical action. As long as trees make history, they threaten industrial
governance. Cleaning the forest is part of the work of stopping this his-
tory. But since when do trees make history? s.167
#tree/as-anti-nature #tree/as-plantation #tree/as-resource #tree/as-history

Yet modern forestry has been based on the reduction of trees—­and
particularly pines—­to self-­contained, equivalent, and unchanging ob-
jects. s.168
#tree/as-abstract #tree/is-pine #tree/as-industry

With modern forestry, we forget that trees are
historical actors. How might we remove the blinders of modern re-
source management to regain a feel for the dynamism so central to the
life of the forest? s.168
#tree/as-industry #tree/as-managed #tree/as-actant

If you ever wanted to be impressed by the historical force of plants, you
might do well to start with pines. Pines are among the most active trees
on earth. If you bulldoze a road through a forest, pine seedlings will
likely spring up on its raw shoulders. If you abandon a field, pines will be
the first trees to colonize it.  s.169
#tree/is-pine #tree/as-actant 

When humans cut down the other
trees, pines move in. s.170
#tree/is-pine #tree/as-actant

Second, there are peasant
landscapes, where farmers have cut back broadleaf trees, sometimes de-
nuding hillsides completely, advantaging pine. s.171
#tree/is-pine #tree/is-broadleaf

Birch was the first tree to arrive after the glaciers; but pine was close
behind. s.172
#tree/is-birch #tree/birch-is-pine #tree/as-nature #tree/as-transformative

 For those of us
used to temperate or tropical forests, this is a very small number of
trees. In Lapland, among forest-­forming trees, there is one pine, one
spruce, and two kinds of birch. s.173
#tree/is-birch #tree/is-pine 

 In Finland, clear-­cutting
aims to mimic the effects of forest fires that replaced whole stands of
trees every century or so in the boreal forests before humans stopped them. s173
#tree/as-managed

This fruiting habit resembles what for trees is called “mast-
ing,” in which trees allocate resources for fruiting only sporadically—­
but then, triggered by long-­term cycles and environmental cues, fruit
massively and all together across an area. s.174
#tree/as-biology 

 Furthermore, mast fruiting occurs in trees
with mycorrhizal partners;  the storage and expenditure necessary for
masting appears to be coordinated between trees and their fungi. Fungi
store carbohydrates for the future fruiting of trees. s.174
#tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-biology

Fungi
store carbohydrates for the future fruiting of trees. Might trees also ac-
commodate the uneven fruiting of fungi?  I know of no research that
tracks how fungal fruiting is coordinated with tree masting, s.174
#tree/as-biology #tree/as-multispecies

 Irregular fruiting offers a not-­
 so-­cyclical rhythm, responding to cross-­year environmental differences and
multiyear coordination between fungi and trees. To specify these rhythms,
we find ourselves speaking in dates, not cycles: s.175
#tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-biology

 In the coordination between fungal and
host tree fruiting, we might begin to appreciate the history making of the
forest, that is, its tracking of irreversible as well as cyclical time.  s.175
#tree/as-host #tree/as-multispecies

And while forceful management
against irregularity can drive some species to extinction, it can never suc-
ceed in transforming trees into creatures without history. s.175
#tree/as-history #tree/as-person #tree/as-managed

One day, my hosts took me to a forest reserve, where we looked at
pines with three-­hundred-­year-­old fire scars. The trees were perhaps five
hundred years old.  New research suggests that there were many areas in
the boreal forest where stand-­replacing fires were rare, and old trees
flourished. Under the trees, we picked mushrooms and spoke of those
that do not flourish with the younger forests of modern timber manage-
ment. But matsutake is lucky. s.176
#tree/as-history #tree/as-cognition #tree/is-pine #tree/descriptive

 Better yet, felled oaks (unlike pines) tend
not to die; they sprout back from roots and stumps to form new trees.
The peasant practice of felling trees in the expectation that they will
grow back from their stumps is called “coppicing,” and coppiced oak
woodlands are exemplary peasant forests.3  Coppiced trees are ever
young and quick growing even as they live for a long time. T s.180
#tree/is-oak #tree/as-tending #tree/descriptive #tree/as-managed #tree/as-permanence #tree/as-supplier

Yet
without human disturbance, pine may give way to oak and other broad-
leaf trees. s.180
#tree/is-pine #tree/is-oak #tree/as-disturbance #tree/is-broadleaf


Male buzzards
feed nesting females during egg incubation. They sit atop pine trees, sur-
veying the landscape, looking for reptiles, amphibians, and insects. s.181
#tree/as-host #tree/as-home #tree/as-multispecies #tree/is-pine

 Without maintenance of the irri-
gation system, the frog population declines.6 And so many insects have
evolved just to live with peasant trees! Konara oak (Quercus serrata) has
at least eighty-­five specialist butterflies that depend on it as food.  s.182
#tree/as-home #tree/as-host #tree/as-multispecies #tree/is-oak

The coppiced oaks were also in trouble. We admired the ancient stools
that had regrown over and over into trees. s.183
#tree/is-oak #tree/as-managed #tree/as-permanence #tree/as-supplier

 Before the
past thirty years, foresters and forest historians were obsessed with the
aristocrats among trees: Japanese cedar and cypress. s.183
#tree/is-japanese-cedar #tree/is-cypress #tree/as-history

There is good reason: these are beautiful and useful trees.  s.183
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-useful #tree/as-aesthetic

Early aristocratic fixation on sugi and hinoki opened possibilities for
peasant claims on other trees—­particularly oaks. s.184
#tree/is-oak #tree/as-claim #tree/is-sugi #tree/is-hinoki

Yet it was unlikely to find
a sugi or hinoki in Japan’s premodern iriai forests; those trees were
claimed by aristocrats, even if they grew on village lands. s.184
#tree/as-claim

What trees defined the iriai village forest? s.184
#tree/as-forrest

Peasants weeded out evergreen oak seedlings, along with the
rest of the underbrush and grass that grew under the trees, privileging
the deciduous species. s.184
#tree/is-oak #tree/as-managed

Japanese red pine is a creature of peasant disturbance. It cannot
compete with broadleaf trees, which both shade it out and create rich
and deep humus layers that only add to their advantage. s.185
#tree/is-pine #tree/as-disturbance #tree/is-broadleaf 

Trees were cut down not only for peasant
uses but also as fuel and building supplies for the military buildup. s.186
#tree/as-political #tree/as-supplier

We spoke of
laws, incentives, and model projects. I hadn’t yet touched the trees. I
missed the aesthetic objects I had come to know in Japan, even as I now
saw their strangeness. s.188
#tree/as-aesthetic

Evergreen oaks dominate the landscape, ranging from shrubs to
coppiced trees. s.188
#tree/is-oak #tree/as-landscape

Commercial
picking of wild mushrooms, not just matsutake but many species, cre-
ates foot traffic in the forest. In some places, groves of serious trees are
still available for a vigorous if illegal timber trade, but in most areas the
trees are thin and small. s.189
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-supplier #tree/as-industry

Forty to fifty years later,
pines had colonized bare spaces, and oak stools had sprouted into trees. s.190
#tree/is-pine #tree/as-transformative #tree/is-oak

After the initial disturbance, as in
China, peasants learned to make the regrowing trees work for them. s.190
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-farm

 Although histori-
ans rush to differentiate the modernization achieved by Japan’s Meiji
Restoration and the failures of China’s Great Leap Forward, from the
perspective of a tree, there may not have been much difference. s.190
#tree/as-history #tree/as-political

People and trees are caught in irreversible histories of disturbance.
But some kinds of disturbance have been followed by regrowth of a sort
that nurtures many lives. s.190
#tree/as-history #tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-disturbance

When old timers explained that Oregon’s
eastern Cascades had once been a center for industrial logging, I could
hardly believe them. All I saw was the highway, flanked by unhealthy-­
looking trees—­although a few roadside signs said “Industrial Forest.” s.193
#tree/as-deseased #tree/as-landscape #tree/as-industry #tree/as-dystopia

 Dead wood lies and leans
everywhere. Trees are often scraggly and either sparse or densely packed.
Dwarf mistletoe and root rot sap their strength. s.194
#tree/as-dystopia #tree/as-nature

They tried clear-­cutting, which created those
dense thickets. They tried saving seed trees and shelterwood, but lone
trees were blown down by the wind and snow. s.194
#tree/as-nature #tree/as-dystopia

Matsutake grows with many host trees in Oregon. In the wet, mixed
conifer forests found at high altitudes, matsutake is abundant with
Shasta red fir, mountain hemlock, and sugar pine. s.195
#tree/as-host #tree/is-conifer #tree/is-red-fir #tree/is-mountain-hemlock #tree/is-sugar-pine

Where the relationship between tree and fungus starts to
get exclusive is the lodgepole pine forests. s.195
#tree/as-multispecies #tree/is-lodgepole-pine

According to historian
William Robbins, these pine forests once were “the most impressive
and spectacular” of Oregon’s interior forests.4 The trees were huge, and
they were surrounded by parklike open country with little underbrush. s.195
#tree/is-pine #tree/descriptive #tree/as-history

All they had to do was replace
“decadent,” “overmature” old growth forests with fast-­growing and vig-
orous young trees, which would be harvestable in predictable eighty-­to
one-­hundred-­year year intervals.  They might even plant superior stock,
making the new forests faster-­growing and more resistant to pests and
diseases. New technologies were making it practical to remove all the
trees, not just the most desirable ones; thus foresters turned to clear-­
cutting. 12 s.196
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-development #tree/as-managed

The open character of
the landscape disappeared as small trees grew in. Pure stands of ponder-
osa became rare.  s.197
#tree/is-ponderosa #tree/as-landscape

Lodgepole, Pinus contorta, is an old resident in the eastern Cascades.
It may have been the first tree to arrive after the glaciers melted.  After
the eruption of Mt. Mazama, lodgepole was one of the few trees that
could grow on pumice flats.  It also flourished in cold pockets on the hill-
side, which were affected by summer frosts that killed other trees, even
ponderosa. s.199
#tree/is-lodgepole-pine #tree/as-history #tree/as-landscape #tree/is-ponderosa

Stumps of sugar pines
litter the high mountains, although living sugar pine has become rare.
Lodgepole was one of the trees not taken. s.200
#tree/is-sugar-pine #tree/is-lodgepole-pine #tree/as-umwelt

Fire thins ponderosa stands, removing
small trees and allowing survivors to dominate hillsides uncrowded by
the demands of others.  In contrast, lodgepole burns readily; its thick
groves, live and dead trees intermingled, spread fire.  s.200
#tree/is-ponderosa #tree/as-umwelt #tree/is-lodgepole-pine

 Dead and live wood intermix; dead trees lean across
live ones. s.200
#tree/as-deseased #tree/as-nature

Fungi are choosy about forest succession. Some are quick to estab-
lish themselves with new trees, while others let the forest mature before
they take hold. s.201
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-multispecies

 No one has gathered clear data on this issue
in Oregon, but foragers and foresters agree: matsutake does not fruit
with young trees. s.201
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-multispecies

 In naturally regenerating forest, perhaps only forty-­to-­fifty-­year-­
old trees begin to support matsutake fruiting. s.201
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-multispecies

 All forest management would
have to be subcontracted to loggers in exchange for the best remaining
trees. s.201
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-supplier #tree/as-resource

Pickers say that fungi destroyed by soil com-

In a bureaucracy that sees
only trees, a mushroom companion has made a splash appearance.
Mistakes were made . . . and mushrooms popped up. s.202
#tree/as-abstract #tree/as-political

Postwar U.S. political culture pushed the optimism of
growth, public and private, as the route to American-­style democracy.
In the United States, this meant opening the national forests to private
loggers. In Japan, this meant converting natural forests to tree planta-
tions. In each case, policymakers looked forward to a future of ex-
panded business opportunities. s.208
#tree/as-plantation #tree/as-industry #tree/as-history #tree/as-political

 Intensive management on private land also took off in Or-
egon, but in the national forests, the 1950s were devoted to cutting.
Great trees were still there for the taking. s.209
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-managed #tree/as-resource #tree/as-industry

Optimism over industrial forestry did not last long. In Japan, the
problem began as early as the 1960s, when enthusiasm over tree planta-
tions ended. s.209
#tree/as-industry #tree/as-plantation

Here is how histo-
rian William Robbins described that period: “When I arrived in Oregon
in the early 1960s, loggers cut trees to water’s edge, ‘cat skinners’ drove
bulldozers through streambeds, and some of the largest timberland
owners were indifferent to reforesting cutover land. s.210
#tree/as-history #tree/as-industry

By 1980, the prices of Japanese do-
mestic wood had fallen so low that almost no one could afford to har-
vest trees. Although intensive management was still strongly promoted
in Oregon, the end was coming. s.211
#tree/as-economy #tree/as-managed

 The fact that everyone’s trees
were the same age did not help prices. s.211
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-economy

 The young plantings had
encouraged herbaceous weeds, which in turn had encouraged a spike in
the deer population; as the trees grew up and shaded out undergrowth,
the deer had nothing to eat and became pests in villages and towns. s.211
#tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-transformative

He learned from peasant knowledge about shiro, including early attempts
to cultivate the fungus. 9 Meanwhile, he explored the implications of the
shiro’s interspecies relationships with trees, even as it raised philosoph­
ical questions. Might we think, he asked, of mutualisms as a form of
love? s.220
#tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-entangled #tree/as-science

However, many insights have been gained, espe-
cially about fungus-­tree relations: relations remain central here. At one
point, Dr. Suzuki brought mature pine trees into his laboratory, con-
structing basement cages in which root symbioses could be observed
and measured in detail. s.221
#tree/is-fungus #tree/as-entangled #tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-science

 U.S. forestry researchers are
under pressure to develop analyses compatible with the scalable man-
agement of timber trees. s.221
#tree/is-timber #tree/as-science #tree/as-managed

 Chinese participants witnessed to the diversity of the for-
est’s fungal life and the newly cordial relations between peasants and
international experts. Japanese scholars savored the rare chance to work
with foreign fungus–­host tree relations. North Koreans were eager to
learn new techniques. s.224
#tree/as-host #tree/as-political

Dr. Knudsen does not think matsutake spread through spores in the
stratosphere; it’s just too improbable that they would find mates. In-
stead, their distribution followed the forests: they spread together with
the trees. This took a long time, but across the northern half of the
earth, many species spread—­ever so slowly—­together. s.229
#tree/as-biology #tree/as-host #tree/as-multispecies

 The fungal body emerges in
historical mergings—­with trees, with other living and nonliving things,
and with itself in other forms. s.238
#tree/as-multispecies #tree/as-host

Pickers also study the forest. They can name host trees. But tree clas-
sification only opens the door, determining the area a picker might
search; s.242
#tree/as-host #tree/as-cognition #tree/as-science

Rather than a class of soils, the picker scans for lines of life. It is not
just the tree that is relevant but the story that the area around it tells. s.243
#tree/as-history #tree/as-cognition #tree/as-landscape

 Instead,
the plant drains sugars from matsutake, which in turn takes them from
the trees. s.243
#tree/as-biology #tree/as-multispecies

Life lines are entangled: candy cane and matsutake; matsutake and
its host trees; host trees and herbs, mosses, insects, soil bacteria, and for-
est animals; s.243
#tree/as-host #tree/as-entangled #tree/as-multispecies

As we walk into the forest, memory gets specific. “Under that tree, I
once found nineteen mushrooms, a whole row, stretching halfway
round the tree.” s.244
#tree/as-cognition #tree/as-landscape

Of course, if that spot is in the middle of nowhere, under a random
bush near a random tree, it’s pretty hard to remember that place from
year to year. s.244
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-cognition

When one arrives
in the spot, the memory washes over one, making every detail of that
time come suddenly clear—­the angle of a leaning tree, the smell of a res-
inous bush, the play of light, the texture of the soil. I have often experi-
enced just that wash of memory. s.244
#tree/as-cognition #tree/descriptive #tree/as-aesthetic

We follow the tracks of earlier harvesters, touching their
remains. Because matsutake, anchored to trees, come up again in the
same spots, this is a surprisingly productive strategy.  s.247

The ground where Moei Lin and Fam Tsoi pick is not the sculpted
moss and lichen carpet of Hiro’s special valley. In the volcanic high des-
ert of the eastern Cascades, the ground is dry; the trees are windblown,
sickly, and sometimes sparse. s.248

By the time we arrived, they
were scattered across the hillside, digging up the roots of the broadleaf
trees that had invaded what once had been a hillside of pines. s.258

They had built a kiln to make charcoal and
made compost heaps to breed the beetles Japanese boys like to collect.
There were fruit trees and vegetable gardens, fertilized by the humus
they had removed, and plans for many more projects. s.259

By the early
1960s, what had once been peasant forests across central Japan had be-
come sugi and hinoki tree plantations. Satoyama groups reacted to
people’s sense of alienation from forests, derived from the dominance
of plantations. s.260

The neglected forests changed, becoming
dense with shrubs and newly established evergreen broadleaf trees. In-
vasive species such as moso bamboo crowded in. The understory of light-­
loving herbs was lost. Pines were smothered in the shade. s.260

These dying pines have condemned the matsutake harvest; without
its host trees, matsutake cannot survive. s.262

The
drop was steep and abrupt. Pine trees were dying. In the 1980s, as Japan’s
economy continued to boom, Japanese matsutake became rare—­and
very valuable. s.262

Humans become only one of
many participants in making livability. Participants wait for trees and
fungi to associate with them. s.263

 One report about satoyama
work by a group of volunteers includes all the problems and mistakes of
their efforts. Without coordination, they cut down too many trees. s.263

 He fenced off
several hectares of forest and built a boardwalk meandering through so
that visiting foresters and researchers could look at a model forest with-
out disturbing it. Without peasant disturbance, the trees in the showcase
forest have grown big and beautiful. s.269

 It is refreshing to walk through this forest, with
its gracefully arching trees and its rich earth smells.  s.269

 Everywhere Mi-
chael Hathaway and I went, broadleaf trees showed signs of extensive
pruning for firewood; many were reduced to much-­hacked bushes. s.269
#tree/is-broadleaf #tree/as-resource

The traffic keeps the forests
open, and thus welcoming to pine; it keeps the humus thin and the soils
poor, thus allowing matsutake to do its good work of enriching trees. s.270

He had his men dig
up rare species of flowering trees from the village forest covered under
his matsutake contract. s.273

 Since the city managers
of Kunming, Yunnan’s capital, demanded that mature trees suddenly
grace what had been treeless streets, he and other entrepreneurs shipped
full-­grown trees into the city.  Most of the trees died from the shock of
removal and transport. But those that lived long enough to garner pay-
ment fetched a tidy profit. As for the forest, at the very least it lost its
diversity—­and the beauty of its flowering trees.

 Although matsutake is known for its relations with liv-
ing trees, it can get some nutrients from dead ones too, her research
showed. s.279

We walked through
the forest’s special places, which he hoped the children, too, might dis-
cover: here two trees (and of different species!) have grown together,
knotted into a single trunk; here some crumbling Buddhist statues
emerged from the brush when he cleaned it back; here a natural stone
split in two reminds him of a woman. s.281

Tanaka-­san had built a small hut on the hillside, and he served tea to
Shiho Satsuka and me while we sat looking down through the trees. s.281

After a while, his brother-­in-­law, a
forest worker, came by, and he told us stories of how the forest was once
logged by lowering trees down wires. s.281
