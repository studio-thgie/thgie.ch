[[20200519192137]] Essay Concept

## Hypothesis / Questions
From the perspective of actor-network-theory, trees are an abundant actant in all thee books we worked with. Nevertheless, this usage of the concept of tree was never truly reflected but just assumed to be given. This essay has a closer look at the application of the concept of tree in the stories told.

## What is a Tree
@Coder2017 and @Ehrenberg2018

## Approach
- going through every single instance of "tree"
- looking at a few sentences as context
- codify that instance
- Emergent categorization
- Context analysis
- Linguistic analysis
- Actor Network Theory

## Goals and methods in the books
The author wanted this and that

### Friction (F)
s.ix This book describes the cultural processes in which certain kinds of
predat ry business practices, on the one hand, and local empowerment
truggles, on the other, came to characterize the rainforests of Indonesia.
s.1 This book is not a history of philosophy, hut rathcr an etlmography of
global councction.
Working
through global connection, tbe book is an exploration of ethnographic
meth ds for studying the work of the universal.
s.3 Thi s book shows how emergent cultural forms- inclu ding forest destruc­
tion and environm ental advocacy-ar e p ersi stent but unpredictable eff e cts
of global encounter s across diff erence . 
T o address these challenges, this book develo ps a portfolio of methods to
study the pr oductive friction of global connections.

s. 4  Cultures arc continually co-produccd
in the interactions I call "friction": the awkward, unequal, unstable, and
creative qualities of interconnection across difference. Each chapter of this
book develops a method for lcarning about such aspects of contingent cn­
counters.


### Land's End (LA)
s. 4 The analytical framework I adopt in this book focuses on the specificity
ofthis conjuncture: the set ofelements, processes, and relations that shaped
people's lives at this time and place, and the political challenges that arise
from that location. My analysis draws on ethnographic research that I con­
ducted through repeated visits over a period oftwenty years (1990-2009). An
ethnographic approach enabled me to pay close attention to the perspectives
of the highlanders themselves and follow struggles and debates as they un­
folded. Revisiting offered insights that are hard to glean from one-shot re­
search designs, whether based on surveys or ethnographic research. 11 lt en­
abled me to track subtle shifts in everyday ways ofthinking and acting before
they had settled into a "new normal" that no langer seemed strange.

My goal in writing this book is to examine closely just what
happened in these highlands and draw out the implications for politics.

s. 5 With this book, I would like to do some more specific,
political work, by challenging policies that promote the intensification of
capitalist relations as a recipe for poverty reduction, and social movement
agendas that render people like Kasar invisible or unrecognizable because
they fail to fit the "alternative-development" niche. If these disruptions are
productive, they can help build a future in which Kasar and his children will
have a part.


s. 17 A conjunctural approach, which attends to "history at one point in time"
and in space, is a form ofanalysis with an illustrious heritage. 46 lt is consis­
tent with Marx's rnethod, which examines the multiple relations that consti­
tute concrete, historical forms. 47 lt is central to the work ofscholars inspired
by Marx who combine attention to processes ofcapital accumulation with an
emphasis on ernergence, contradiction, contestation, agency, and struggle­
in short, the specific features of a conjuncture and the rnany relations that
form it. 48 We find it in the work of feminist and postcolonial scholars who
have broadened Marx's capital/labor framework to exarnine how relations be­
tween genders, generations, and social groups distinguished by ethnic iden­
tity or religion shape resource access and mechanisms of accumulation. 49
We find it in the work of scholars inspired by Gramsci, who explore the way
in which power is lived and inequality is normalized at the nexus of force,
consent, and the production of desires for particular ways of living. so lt is
especially prominent in the work of geographers who build on the work of
Henri Lefebvre. 5

s. 19 y account in
this book builds on these understandings of the subject as an agent whose
desires don't stand outside a conjuncture but are formed within it, and are
formative in turn.


### Mushroom at the End of the the World (MatEoftW)

s. viii Following a mushroom, this book offers such true stories. Unlike
most scholarly books, what follows is a riot of short chapters. I wanted
them to be like the flushes of rnushrooms that come up afl:er a rain: an
over-the-top bounty; a ternptation to explore; an always too many.
 To know the world without
t�em, this book sketches open-ended assemblages of entangled ways of
life, as these coalesce in coordination across many kinds of temporal
rhythms. My experiment in form and my argument follow each other.

s. 2 This book is not a critique of the dreams of mod­
ernization and progress that offered a vision of stability in the twentieth
century; many analysts before me have dissected those dreams. Instead,
I address the imaginative challenge of living without those handrails
which once made us think we knew, collectively, where we were going'.

### On goals and methods

The authors already set the tone for the book to follow

- tsing not keen on referencing
- li positions herself and the work clearly in political work


## General 
In the following I will state a few generalisation about how trees are written about in each book. This should give a general overview on the topic of trees in the different arcs. I tried to find generalisations around the following criteria

- how are tree describes, what language is used
- what kind of types of trees are mentioned
- in which domains of knowledge are trees placed, for example biology or economy
- is there a tree-specific vocabulary

### Friction

- often states the local names of the tree species
- #tree/as-cognition: trees serving as memory holders for the locals, but are abstracted to become resources (maps drawn, some species ignored)
- trees are frequently described with adjectives (big, colorful)
- variety of trees present, not only useful ones 

### Land's End

- tree is often used together with concepts like assets, cash, enterprise, investment etc
- unconsciously defines what tree is and uses this throughout the book
- usage/scope of tree consistent with scope of goal: tree as a resource in marx theory
- she talks about the material condition of the landscape (something grows on it or not, draught) and trees (age, sturdiness in ulat process, permanence)

### Mushroom

- deseases (nematodes) are described in their effect on the tree first (unlike lands end where it's about the economic or sustenance loss)
- describes the structures (forrest) emerging from certain trees (irrai, borreal)
- whereas li uses tree in regional or local political issues, tsing often takes up national relations
