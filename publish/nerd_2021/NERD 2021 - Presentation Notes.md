# NERD 2021 - Presentation Notes

- Welcoming
	- animism in design
	- thanking for presence, opportunity
	- joke on NERD acronym
	- introduce myself
- Overview Presentation
	- Animism
	- Research Design
	- Findings and Implications
- Quote
	- Qualities of/in Design
- On Animism
	- is one of this terms
		- applied in different areas
	- animism as treating or seeing other-than-human things as a subjects, different sources and different expression, other-than-human that is treated human-like
	- Matrix
		- Phenomenological / Epistemological - Sources of animist view
		- Reactive / Active - Practices 
- Examples
	- Hari-Kuyo (epi/a)
	- Roomba (phe/a)
		- roombification example
	- Aibo (phe-epi/re-a -> epi/a)
- Hypothesis / Question
	- focus on tech things because of my background
- Research Design
	- 3 phases, collecting, analysis and prototyping
	- Looked at Problem through Industrial Design
		- Focus on materialities and product design
	- Emotional Durable Design
		- Waste is a failed Relationship
	- Focus on voice assistants
		- Relatively new, rapidly established itself, act of speaking to a thing lends itself
	- Weak Signals, to be extrapolated into testable prototype
		- what are these in general and in the context of this project
		- why was that important
			- animist practices still present, ie Piguet research on animism in children
-  Research Body / Data
	- ~25h of direct observation in the homes of owners of VAs
	- several interviews with longtime owners of VAs
	- user journeys of unboxing and setup of new owners of VAs
	- also collected online voices, as well as images of advertisements as well as hacked or customized voice assistants
	- Workshop
		- capture the voices of designers and their respective disciplines
		- working with research body, pre-findings / pre-themes
		- taking methods from speculative/future design
		- produce stories that imagine alternative near future scenarios of how we live with VAs
- Thematic Analysis
	- process of TA (data -> labeling -> Themes)
	- comparable to affinity mapping, but more of a deep reading
	- reflexive approach after Brown and Clarke
		- intuitively and according with my own values as research as an embodied practice -> quote "creating, not emerging"
		- trail of truth
		- reflexive in the work -> journal, describing
	- 220 codes, 6 subthemes and 1 final theme
- Findings
	- Slightly disappointed at findings but were to be expected
	- was set out to discover and work with weak signals of active practices coming from an epistemological source -> top right
	- found reactive practices coming from a phenomenological basis -> bottom left
		- place VAs on Matrix (phe/re)
	- two themes; trust issues, uncanny valley
	- Found ample examples of the uncanny valley
		- VAs treated as non-human actants but often creepy
			- device activation, unnatural communication, sheer presence
			- Participants miss a proper vocabulary to deal with the non-human presence in case of errors and generally have a hard time bonding with VAs
- Trust Issues
	- Privacy, Intimacy, Consent
	- Macro -> Micro
		- Macro; Privacy -> closed sourced technologies and data tracking practices
		- Midi; Intimacy -> VAs as invisible interfaces entziehen sich in a negotiation of intimacy, while still embeding themselves in the social strata of the home
		- Micro; Consent -> No control in exchange, the user is unable to disagree
	- Alexa Alien anecdote
-  Implication
	- from animism in the focus to animism as a given
		- usage of animism is more reflected now with the help of the matrix
		- was able to focus research question
	- prototyping user journeys
		- how can we negotiate trust, respectively privacy, intimacy and consent with iot devices like voice assistants
		- shift from materialities and product design to interaction and user experience design

- Optional
		- betti marenkos neo-animism in design framework
			- uncertainity (ambiguity) to encourage exploration of system as well as relateability
		- Ambiguity
		- jonathan chapmans emotionally durable design 		
		- roomba is rambo principles
