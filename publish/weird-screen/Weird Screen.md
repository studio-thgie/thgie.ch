# Weird Screen
Weird Screen grew out of a liitle screening project by Florence Aellen and Adrian Demleitner. We wanted to show those movies we like and that  most people aren't crossing path with. Movies that are beautiful or moving but take a lot of energy to process, present material that is hard to grasp, or present themselves in a matter that is hard to take in.

On this blog we collect our thoughts. We're not professional journalists and will post full-fledged reviews. Movies are excellent media to collectively think with and through. We hope that our thoughts grow over time, to something unique and valuable.
