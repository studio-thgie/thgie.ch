# Outline DHCH 2022

- What is the goal of the presentation?
	- I want to talk about digital sustainability, in the sense of writing software that lives long and prosper
- What do I want to convey/transport?
	- That often, convenience and imaginaries stands in the way of such sustainability
	- What I think, are good approaches to digital sutainability
- What do I want to know, what questions would I love to have answered?
	- Feedback on my thoughts/our approaches
	- What are other approaches to digital sustainability
- Can I link the presentation to my dissertation?
	- Maybe in aspects, but not very clearly at this moment

## Some thoughts
Peter asked me to do this presentation, because I'm a future phd candidate and because I spoke about the problems of the product imaginary and how it affects our methods and working in the now.

## Literaturrecherche
- prototypes as epistemological objects

---

- ~ 1/3 Artifacts and entropy
- ~ 1/3 PIA
- ~ 1/3 From methods to practice

0. Mentioning my background in design research with social relevance and what it means in terms of research lenses (social, user experience, communicative)
	- also that I'm sci. software dev and have this double part of doing research and providing a paid service
	- goal of presentation is at once talking about practicalities and sci. interests
	- what is a prototype?
		- in research we are usually interested in prototypes, not products, which has big implications on our methods
1. Outlining why tech artefacts are important
	- artifacts as sociotechnical objects (latour)
	- they contain knowledge that can't be expressed otherwise
2. challenges that work against us
	- entropies, rots and dependencies
	- near certain death w/o maintenance
3. contextualising pia
	- organisation of the project
	- ![[image 10.jpg]]
	- two temporalities that directly influence our methods
		- now: dissertations based on work on/with prototype
		- after: visions/imaginaries of of project ending and beyond
	- output is a prototype (see snf application)
4. from methods to practice
	- i mention pia because of three factors that influence methods and practice
		- we're interested in a prototype
		- we're are an interdisciplinary field that needs to find ways to let each other participate in our respective fields
		- the problems of practice versus imaginaries is something that I feel, we all have often
	- what is participation?
		- go into one or two models
	- participation as a strategy of creating sustainable artifacts
		- reduce complexities/dependecies
			- use tested, stable and widly applied techstacks
			- use weakest tech
		- documentation
			- 4 layers of tech doc (doc, guide, examples, blogging)
		- artifacts (computing) at human scale
			- between postgres and csv (openable in any spreadsheet software)
5. facit
	- "Boils down to enabling Participation on a tech Level" [^1]
	- communicative strategies to create accessibility in order to facilite participation
	- it is about pushing our artefacts as much as possible into human realm as possible
	- not unlike universal design


[^1]: Does it, really? Yes, maybe it does.
