- a definition of animism
    - [[Animism]]
    - [[Colonialism role in Animism]]

- frictionless design and relationships
    - [[Frictionless Design und Objekt-Mensch-Beziehung]]
    - [[Technologische Artefakte ohne Narrative]]
    - [todo] dark patterns

- animism as a way forward through its poetics
    - [[Poetics of Animism]]

- animism is not an solution for the problems at hand but an active way how we think and act towards technology
    - this does not tackle the injustices that are embedded and advanced by current technologies 
    - its a rather philosophical approach and i hope there is some pedagogy hidden in it, but that is to be seen
    - animism as a way to make something accessible to human without anthropmorphing it
    - akin to the multispecies discourse in anthropology
    - we're not having a culture around this, so we must create one through research, the arts and practice

- methods
    - fake it till you make it: treating as non-human person, ie speaking (interaction)
    - follow the thing (complexity)
    - repair (destroying the illusion of frictionlessness)
