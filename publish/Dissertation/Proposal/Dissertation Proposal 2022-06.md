## Challenges

## Abstract
The infrastructure of an archive manifests its participatory ontology and shapes the possible space for epistemological practices. This research proposal wants to look at the development of a digital image archive from an infrastructural point of view and inquire how design decisions and technical implementations on that level influence its participatory character. The specific focus of this work is the inquiry into the imaginaries and models of communal managed data, which is regarded as the core materiality of a digital archive.

## Problems and general questions
Interesting in this context is the comparison to public libraries, which have similar epistemological functions, but a different approach towards the public, the outside. Libraries, says Shannon Mattern, "are designed through really robust programs of civic engagement", and "that [the] really diverse local community is often invited into the design process" [@ShannonMattern2022]. The outcome of those processes is often, that the community feels a sense of ownership in this particular place.

I argue that we are partially trying to achieve this engagement and shared ownership but from the position of an archive. To be able to do so we need to figure out ways to apply this kind of thinking to the archive's infrastructure. This problem becomes especially interesting regarding the concept of data, which I regard as the principal content holder and one of the most important aspects of a digital archive.

Data is generally viewed as technical means. This is due to not many people beyond technological specialists understanding the processes needed to constitute and maintain data objects. This leaves little space for anthropologists, designers, and amateurs to co-create and develop a shared understanding of what data is and could be. Data should be considered a central aspect of the digital archive and thus be designed, conceived, and developed by all relevant stakeholders.

What we need in a participatory digital archive is not only a technical framework for constituting and maintaining data objects but also imaginaries and legal procedures for communal management of data. This calls for an interdisciplinary approach, in which not only technological solutions are devised but equally communicated and designed in communal and participatory ways.

## Data as transversal materiality
Data is the precursor of information, often comprising individual facts or pieces of information. This can be a date, a title, or the description of an image. For the sake of this proposal, even an image itself can be considered data. Contemporary data constitution is relational and often pertains to a format. A date is not much worth on its own. But if it is denominated as a birthday of a specific person, it becomes very valuable.

Whereas the tech industry at large is interested in collecting and farming data as a means of financial incentive, the digital archive has the chance to develop an alternative imaginary towards communal stewardship of the cultural heritage contained in data. This means that we need equal parts technical solutions, designerly interventions, and community building to build participatory archival infrastructures.

Within the infrastructure of a digital archive, data becomes a boundary object between the many actants that partake in archival activities. It draws a transversal line from the outside to the inside, and back again. Various actants add various pieces of data to an archive, through various kinds of processes. All these actants narratives are more or less loosely entangled with the content of the archive. Might it be as a researcher, inquiring about our history, as an archive maintainer cleaning up data and organizing it, or might it be as an amateur weaving their memories into the archive through participatory processes. All of these people have a stake, as well as shared ownership, of the archive's data, although seldomly mirrored legally.

The Projects central research questions would then be as follows.

- What are communal and participative models and imaginaries of constituting and caring for data within a digital image archive?
- How does the data infrastructure need to be designed and built to support such communal and participative models?
