# Dissertation Sketch
The dissertation is placed at the intersection of these three subjects: Digital archives, participation and infrastructures. All three are dear to me on their own, have a right to be worked on, and their own backstory.

I'm generally interested in storing, working on and sharing knowledge and many of my personal projects went in that direction. Participation is something I regard as an ehtical imperativ. No justice without participation. I understand participation as something which has to actively be created over and over again is not simply solveable through tools. Infrastructures is my main mode of analysis, discourse and practice. I'm a tech person; I design, create, maintain, and evaluate digital infrastructures.

I'd love to bring these together, but haven't found a specific use case yet.
