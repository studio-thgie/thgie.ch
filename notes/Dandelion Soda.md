# Dandelion Soda
> It’s spring and that means foraging. After the obligatory wild garlic now it’s time for dandelion stuff. I’m about to ferment myself some soda. [](https://post.lurk.org/web/statuses/108153695079504177)

Collect four handful of dandelion heads, cut off the petals, add 80g sugar and pour over 1.5l of boiling water. When cooled down add a starter of your liking. A ginger bug works great. I’m going to use leftover kombucha which developed some good yeast on the ground.
