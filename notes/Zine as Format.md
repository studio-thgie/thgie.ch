# Zines
> Research is an ongoing process. Most of the time the output of a research project gets public at the end of it. We take here a different approach and show what we are doing along the way. Because of its basic and minimalistic character, the fanzine format allows to give a glimpse of the field material we produce. Of course it can be quite mysterious at first glance but each issue compiles different artefacts we are interested in.
