# Radical Animism and Design

I want us to understand, that these things are us and most belong to us. I want us to understand, that these things have the ontological rights, to exist and be treated good.

I want us to remove the notion of *products* and thus the notion of *users*. There are only people, human as well as non-human, which are in in constant emerging dances which each other.

I want us to understand, that capitalism is nothing, but that the most important drivers of our world is non-paid work  (of developers, marginalized, care-work, etc)

The spirit within lets us see the egregore of us.
