# Frontiers - Grenzen
I use the term frontier from a neoliberal perspective. As something that holds potential value that can be extracted, but which story must be altered in order to make it ethically ok to do so.

An example are rainforrest, which are always densely populated areas, but which are redrawn as the dangerous wilderness, that must be conquered by civilization.
