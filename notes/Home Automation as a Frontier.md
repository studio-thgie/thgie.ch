# Home Automation as a Frontier
In terms of technological progress, aka innovation, the human body is seen as a frontier that needs to be colonized by technoid solutions, enhancements, new features. Points of entry are our senses, sight, haptic, hearing. The sender of smell is hard to tackle since it relies on biochemical processes for transmission.

The home is another frontier that is worked on through the internet of things. Technological threads are weaving themselves into our most sacred places. In the eyes of the big tech companies and neoliberal startups, our homes are never good enough. They must be automated, secured, simplified, controlled. All through the specific solutions that the different techno-ecosystems by different companies provide.
