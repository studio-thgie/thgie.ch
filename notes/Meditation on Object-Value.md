# Meditation on Object-Value

- take object close by or dear to heart
- hold it, in hands or mind
- feel it, see it, smell it, think about it, close eyes
- think about one of the many values it can have to you
- memory, common history, daily use
- try to explain this value to a friend
- try to have a conversation with this value, say thank you
