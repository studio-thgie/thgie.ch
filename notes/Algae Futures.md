# Algae Futures
Since a while I'm interested in the idea of farming algae at home. I think the spark for this specific curiosity is a nearby spirulina farm: [Spiruline Bienne](http://spirulinebienne.ch)[^1]. I later came across the [Spirulina Society](https://anyamuangkote.info/spirulina-society), which is an initiative by Anya Muangkote and is "provid[ing] open-source tools and knowledge for domestic Spirulina cultivation". Which is pretty rad if you ask me. For now, the technicalities (feding the algae the right kind of fertilizer mix), as well as the time I'd need to get into it kept me from diving in.
