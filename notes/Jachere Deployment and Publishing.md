# Jachère Deployment and Publishing
As of April 2022, [jache.re](https://jache.re) is running on a Raspberry Pi 4, served as static files through [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com). The content of la Jachère is managed and collaboratively edited through a [git repository](https://github.com/thgie/jache.re), currently residing at Github.

The deployment is triggered by a git hook, which is a bash script that is run at a specific event in the git process. In this case it is the post-merge event/hook, which is triggered after a pull and merge.

I opted for pandoc, since I wanted to keep it simple in terms of tools and toolchain and because some of the content uses citations that are fed from a bibtex file. The file is generated by an automatic export of [the Jachère Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4323256/jachre/library).

The scripts and triggers necessarily for the deployment are released and managed through [the pancake.sh repository](https://github.com/thgie/pancake.sh).
