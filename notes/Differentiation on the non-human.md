# Differentiation on the non-human

There are two aspects of the non-human.

The first is the differentiation between that, which we can understand as to be human and that which is not. For example, we can understand humans to be humans and stones to be not.

The second is that a differentiation of what is worthy of being human and that which is not. For example the rationale white man and the savage.

Both are violent colonial and exploitative practices that need to be addressed [@lewisMakingKinMachines2018]. This practices are also intricately linked to alienation, as described by Marx.
