# Techno-Animism

- the airpod as a techno-cultural object disengages the wearer even more from being in the world. it is neo-colonial in it's frontiermaking of the human body. cloudification without spirits, grounded in the material, make the wearer into a branded experience
- objects are never cheap. and with that I don't mean its value in terms of money. every single human-made object in existence carries with it such a enourmous complexity that once you follow-the-thing, you'll realise that its cost in terms of expended energy is unpayable

"In other words, the shift from everyday object to sacred object is marked by a transformation of the object into event." in how far does a commodity fetish become an event and devoid of usefulness?
