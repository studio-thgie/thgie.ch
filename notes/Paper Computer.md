# Paper Computer
I'm super fascinated by paper computers. These are a paper based tool to teach the basics of computing. I came acress them somewhere on a Mastodon instance and I liked it because they are quite close to assembler programming, whereas assembler has some more options. At least in the case of [[notes/uxn]].

I watched the following two videos by Chris Staecker.

- [# Paper Computers #1: Der Know How Computer (WDR Papiercomputer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z27KQiBnkJI)
- [# Paper Computers #2: The Little Man Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-mOfXhgfQY)

They are fantastic, and brief primers on paper computers. Worth the view.
