# Tech Paradigms
It seems like, there are two fundamentally different paradigms at play within the development of tech. At one end we have tech designed to control. This paradigm is applied by the military industry, governement actants as well as profit-driven companies. On the other hand we have tech understood as infrastructural, meaning no life as we have it without tech; no us without tech. This paradigm is worked by intersectional activists and scholars as well as people acting within disability discourses. And it's especially the later who drive this approach home.

Voice assistants seem to be a relative new thing but voice user input and auditive interaction has been crucial for people with visual or mobility disabilities since the advent of these technologies.
