# Geschichten erzählen - Storytelling
> “Stories are how we remember; we tend to forget lists and bullet points.” - Robert McKee

So basically, good stories needs or wants to appeal to people's emotions. A few important points for storytelling as seen as from communication designs. A good story...

- ...contains a reason *why* (this projects or product is important)
- ...has a *main character* (doesn't need to a human person)
- ...starts with a *conflict* that can be *resolved* throughout the story
- ...has some kind of *structure* (for example the three-act structure)
- ...creates *awareness* of your topic
- ...lends itself to *virality*, so it is passed on

This main points are not only for products you want to sell. For example, if you have a presentation of your thesis and it sticks, people will tell other people about your research and that is certainly a good thing. You want to explain your listeners the value of what you do.
