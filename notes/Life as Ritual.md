> For a life of harmonious ease, find the rhythm in the everyday: make your world your temple and submit to its sacred ritual

## How to set yourself free with ritual

1.  **Ritual is not about stale traditionalism.** The teachings of Confucius’s _Analects_ are about submission to life-as-ritual, not about enforcing the status quo or obeying fusty old rules.
2.  **Ritual is about reverence.** Treat the world around you seriously, with respect for its rhythms and patterns.
3.  **Everything is ritual**. We shouldn’t restrict the scope of ritual to activities such as weddings and funerals. The world is a sacred space with its own patterns, and we can ritually harmonise with it at all times.
4.  **Ritual is even better than good habits**. Habits are inflexible, and that’s a liability. Confucian ritual is flexible, and performing it properly entails willingness to adjust yourself to different contexts.
5.  **Never stop studying**. Except for a few geniuses, seeing the patterns of the world can be tough. Reading widely and asking questions when you’re confused is, itself, part of ritual.
6.  **You can’t fake it until you make it**. Without cultivating sincerity and kindness, your rituals will be hollow. A fake ritual is not a ritual at all, no matter how much it looks like one.
