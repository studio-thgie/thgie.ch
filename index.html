        <p>My name’s Adrian (Demleitner) and my pronouns are he/him. My interests are coding and diy technologies as well as translating theory into other discourses. My subjects of interests cover all kinds of epistemologies, hacking as a creative strategy, new materialism as well as the multi-species discourse, poetic technologies, queer politics, archival practices and game studies. I’m active in these fields of inquiry through curatorial and artistic practices, design research as well as hosting events focusing on knowledge transfer and participation.</p>
        <p>I studied industrial design at <a href="https://www.hypermagazine.ch/">Hyperwerk</a> and just recently finished a MA in design research at <a href="https://www.hkb-ma-design.ch/en/home-118.html">MAD HKB</a>. In the coming years, I will work on my dissertation in the field of game studies within the research project <a href="https://chludens.hypotheses.org/">Confederatio Ludens</a>. There I will concentrate on the analysis of the visual rhetoric of video games.</p>
        <p>My last few working positions involved being a scientific software programmer in a research project on participatory image archives at the <a href="https://dbis.dmi.unibas.ch/research/projects/pia/">University of Basel</a> and enjoying a position as junior researcher at the <a href="https://www.ixdm.ch">Institute of Experimental Design and Media Cultures</a> in a project on <a href="https://times-of-waste.ch/en/">electronic waste</a>. I hold quite a few shorter and longer positions as frontend, fullstack or lead webdeveloper over the last 20 years.</p>
