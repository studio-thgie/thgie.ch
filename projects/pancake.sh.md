# pancake.sh
... uses pandoc to render html files from markdown. I choose pandoc because I wanted to keep the toolchain simple and because it can render citations from a bibtex file, which is pretty awesome.

It lives at [https://github.com/thgie/pancake.sh](https://github.com/thgie/pancake.sh) for the moment.

I really love this idea about having a tool that converts every digital -born and written document in every other format possible.
