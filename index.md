My name's Adrian (Demleitner) and my pronouns are he/him. My interests are coding and diy technologies as well as translating theory into other discourses. My subjects of interests cover all kinds of epistemologies, hacking as a creative strategy, new materialism as well as the multi-species discourse, poetic technologies, queer politics, archival practices and game studies. Iâ€™m active in these fields of inquiry through curatorial and artistic practices, design research as well as hosting events focusing on knowledge transfer and participation.

I studied industrial design at [Hyperwerk](https://www.hypermagazine.ch/) and just recently finished a MA in design research at [MAD HKB](https://www.hkb-ma-design.ch/en/home-118.html). In the coming years, I will work on my dissertation in the field of game studies within the research project [Confederatio Ludens](https://chludens.hypotheses.org/). There I will concentrate on the analysis of the visual rhetoric of video games.

My last few working positions involved being a scientific software programmer in a research project on participatory image archives at the [University of Basel](https://dbis.dmi.unibas.ch/research/projects/pia/) and enjoying a position as junior researcher at the [Institute of Experimental Design and Media Cultures](https://www.ixdm.ch) in a project on [electronic waste](https://times-of-waste.ch/en/). I hold quite a few shorter and longer positions as frontend, fullstack or lead webdeveloper over the last 20 years.
