My name's Adrian (Demleitner) and my interests are coding and diy technologies as well as translating theory into other discourses. My subjects of interests cover all kinds of epistemologies, hacking as a creative strategy, posthumanism/new materialism as well as the multi-species discourse, poetic technologies, queer politics and archival practices. I’m active in these fields of inquiry through curatorial and artistic practices, design research as well as hosting events focusing on knowledge transfer and participation.

I studied industrial design at [Hyperwerk](https://www.hypermagazine.ch/) and just recently finished a MA in design research at [MAD HKB](https://www.hkb-ma-design.ch/en/home-118.html). I’m working as a scientific software programmer in a research project on participatory image archives at the [University of Basel](https://dbis.dmi.unibas.ch/research/projects/pia/) and until recently I enjoyed a position as junior researcher at the [Institute of Experimental Design and Media Cultures](https://www.ixdm.ch) in a project on [electronic waste](https://times-of-waste.ch/en/). I hold quite a few shorter and longer positions as webdeveloper over the last 15 years.
