Against Purity: Living Ethically in Compromised Times
Alexis Shotwell

But also this copy constellates brilliantly an ethos I believe we could—if it were measurable in geologic time—use to mark the beginning of the Anthropocene: roughly, the moment that humans worry that we have lost a natural state of purity or decide that purity is something we ought to pursue and defend.
LOCATION: 90

Thinking about politics, my problem in this book, and “our” problem in this world, is how to have simultaneously an account of radical historical contingency of the conditions under which we take ethical and political action, critical practices for accounting for our own situatedness in histories that have shaped the conditions of possibility for our actions, and a no-nonsense commitment to the kind of real, possible world Haraway describes. That world is partially shared, offers finite freedom, adequate abundance, modest meaning, and limited happiness. Partial, finite, adequate, modest, limited—and yet worth working on, with, and for.

We cannot look directly at the past because we cannot imagine what it would mean to live responsibly toward it. We yearn for different futures, but we can’t imagine how to get there from here.

People are not equally responsible or capable, and are not equally called to respond. But however the bounds of the “we” are drawn, we are not, ever, pure. We’re complicit, implicated, tied in to things we abjure. This is a kind of impurity implied in the sense of “compromised living” that involves making concessions.
LOCATION: 162

We need to shape better practices of responsibility and memory for our placement in relation to the past, our implication in the present, and our potential creation of different futures.
LOCATION: 181

if we want a world with less suffering and more flourishing, it would be useful to perceive complexity and complicity as the constitutive situation of our lives, rather than as things we should avoid.
LOCATION: 184

The question becomes, for Tsing and for me, how to delineate forms of disturbance in relation to what forms of life they sustain or proliferate. In the last section of this book, I offer normative guidance for life-promotion with the concept of flourishing—situated, historically placed, contingent. How we pursue flourishing, as I argue there, will always involve an in-process, syncretic, speculative fabulation, an improvisational engagement with emergence. The blasted landscapes of disturbance regimes are part of our everyday experience, and aiming for a more open field of the patchy differences where we might find hope is also going to have to be an everyday practice.

Being continuous with everything on earth is a starting point for critical inquiry, rather than an explanatory end. That we are coconstituted and thus polluted and impure hails us to make continually contingent and unsettled decisions about how to be in relation to the world, with no predetermined answer.
LOCATION: 229

possessive individualism is densely racialized; the core idea that our selves are owned by us functions as a categorical move to lay out a map of who can own others.
LOCATION: 263

In other words, purity practices are also productive normative formulations—they make a claim that a certain way of being is aspired to, good, or to be pursued. Concepts matter for what we do and how we are in the world. As Donna Haraway puts it, “‘Ideas’ are themselves technologies for pursuing inquiries. It’s not just that ideas are embedded in practices; they are technical practices of situated kinds”
LOCATION: 295

Syncretism names a way to understand the way that different ways of being, traditions, priorities, and practices come to get on together—syncretisms are, for them, necessary to thinking about all practices in the real world, because practices always manage constitutive noncoherence—the fact that the world is made up of things that seem to hang together but that require work to hold in place.
LOCATION: 311

To be against purity is, again, not to be for pollution, harm, sickness, or premature death. It is to be against the rhetorical or conceptual attempt to delineate and delimit the world into something separable, disentangled, and homogenous.

I am “firmly planted against the logic of boundedness.” I follow her argument “for intercommunalism from the midst of impure subjects, negotiating life transgressing the categorical understandings of a logic of binaries that produces hard-edged, ossified, exclusive groups”
LOCATION: 332

Under conditions of oppression and exploitation, how might we enact practices of freedom that can shape worlds we currently cannot imagine? I argue for what I call open normativities: collectively crafted ways of being that shape subjectivities oriented toward widespread future flourishing.

The book concludes by elaborating the idea of “identifying into” queer disability politics.

Being against in this way—having a “no”—involves also the Zapatismo invocation of the possibility of “many yesses.”

“The two participants in the relationship—Europeans and Iroquois—can share the same space and travel into the future, yet neither can steer the other’s vessel.

The CEP and IAP can be read, in the place of more fundamental transformation of the world, as a form of healthism: the harms of residential schools come from the systemic violence of colonialism, but it is up to individuals to prove their effects and manage their response to these harms.

Ignorance is not just an absence of knowledge; it is a way to (not) know things.
LOCATION: 683

One way to understand what is at play here is through imagining a kind of benign ignorance—people just haven’t been taught the facts of the situation, and so they can’t be held responsible for not understanding how race, poverty, indigeneity, and more, are present in their lives. If this were the problem, just giving people more and better information would correct their knowledge problem. But we don’t just have a knowledge problem—we have a habit-of-being problem; the problem of whiteness is a problem of what we expect, our ways of being, bodily-ness, and how we understand ourselves as “placed” in time. Whiteness is a problem of being shaped to think that other people are the problem. Another way to understand this dynamic is to realize the very complex entanglement of practices and habits of ignorance, repression, and active disavowal that constitute an active settler process of not telling, not seeing, and not understanding the truth of the matter, which is a truth of being shaped as the legacy of the harms of the past.
LOCATION: 689

How can we tell the full complexity of this narrative in a way that foregrounds the needs and interests of people most affected by vectors of oppression and vulnerability—without reinscribing the very categories delimiting purity and impurity that were deployed to organize this form of colonization, and without inscribing an ontology of vulnerability as definitive of Indigenous being?

Memory always has a social and a historical character. Our experiences are remembered through social language and through how we make sense of them to ourselves and others” (Kinsman and Gentile, 37). If memory is collective in these ways, it may be that unforgetting contributes to generating a will and an energy to act, and not simply an enhanced knowledge or understanding. The social and historical character of memory and remembering places our memory practices in political and social context, and opens the question of what the people implicated in a particular history can do in response to it. This is why thinking about history is useable in organizing.

Campbell argues that we should “regard remembering as itself a relational capacity interwoven with identity formation” (Campbell 2014, 91), giving an account of how such a relational conception of remembering helps us respond to the historical and present harms of colonialism.
LOCATION: 804

any useful understanding of memory as an ethical and political matter will resist essentializing, especially frozen-in-the-past, conceptions of Indigenous identity.
LOCATION: 846

Non-Indigenous Canadians can respect this non-essentializing imperative along with the very different and valuable models of sociable memory evident in Indigenous teachings. These teachings express and revitalize rich traditions of public remembering that assume remembering is most naturally an interactive, collaborative, and profoundly ethical activity; that sharing the past is critical to the epistemic and ethical fidelity of memory; that memory plays a fundamental role in making and maintaining relations; and that it is an important way to renew and transform intergroup relations.
LOCATION: 848

We should think of memory as a relational and situated process through which we collectively determine the significance of the past for the present as a form of forward-looking responsibility.

She defines sovereignty as a right to be responsible, which requires a relationship with territory (and not a relationship based on control of that territory). . . . What must be understood then is that Aboriginal request to have our sovereignty respected is really a request to be responsible. I do not know of anywhere else in history where a group of people have had to fight so hard just to be responsible.
LOCATION: 903

Ontologically, though, I follow many Indigenous thinkers in understanding that the Canadian state’s classificatory attempts, its work toward dispossession, does not have standing in determining who is Indigenous, who has what sort of relation to place, and what constitutes community and right relation.

explicate the position that land occupies as an ontological framework for understanding relationships. Seen in this light, it is a profound misunderstanding to think of land or place as simply some material object of profound importance to Indigenous cultures (although it is this too); instead, it ought to be understood as a field of “relationships of things to each other.” Place is a way of knowing, of experiencing and relating to the world and with others; and sometimes these relational practices and forms of knowledge guide forms of resistance against other rationalizations of the world that threaten to erase or destroy our senses of place.
LOCATION: 940

“Sovereignty, when defined as my right to be responsible, is really a question of identity (both individual and collective) more than it is a question of an individualized property right. Identity, as I have come to understand it, requires a relationship with territory (and not a relationship based on control of that territory)” (Monture-Angus 1999, 36).
LOCATION: 949

I believe that such responsibility will start with a commitment and practice that asks: How does this potential action resist or reinforce colonial dispossession in any of the relevant senses? How does any proposed action resist healthism and hold in mind a collective web of relationality?

And yet if we follow her thinking about expressive uptake and the capacity to form feeling subjectivities, we see that her understanding of memory is profoundly connected to her account of the political dimensions of affective expression and the ways that affect is always relational (and therefore always also political). The relational and political dimensions of affect are fruitfully understood in terms of relational conceptions of selfhood. Consonant with relational accounts of self-formation, Campbell emphasizes the social or relational nature of personhood: we cannot understand persons, she thinks, as atomized and isolated individuals. Campbell argues: “We develop and live our lives as persons within complex networks of institutional, personal, professional, interpersonal, and political relationships—both chosen and unchosen. We are shaped in and through our interactions with others in ways that are ongoing” (Campbell 2003, 155–56). The work of memory is part of the network of interaction that shapes us as persons. Memory is held not only, or perhaps even not primarily, in our skull. Rather, it might be best understood as “held” within precisely the complex network of relationships that shapes affect and personhood.
LOCATION: 1101

Campbell argues, in contrast, for a relational account, stressing the “dynamic, embodied, reconstructive, and social nature of human recollection” (Campbell 2014, 73). She highlights modes of remembering that see memory as situated in the invested and particular present, as changeable, as collectively shaped and (sometimes) collectively held. This conception of memory, which she also sometimes calls “reconstructive,” is not necessarily new—it also expresses certain Indigenous modes of honoring the past in the context of the present. Understanding memory as relational involves, in part, valuing the work others can do to help us articulate and understand our past. It involves thinking of memory as inherently impure in relevant ways, and holding that impurity up as generative and, actually, good.

First, recognizing the contingency and malleability of what happened in the past reminds us that the world we experience now is a product of complex social relations, which continue to have ramifying effects in the present. Second, attending to how we remember the past calls on us to consider how and why we remember, and to recognize that these practices are situated and invested rather than natural and inevitable.

Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star define classification as: “a spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal segmentation of the world. A classification is a set of boxes (metaphorical or literal) into which things can be put to then do some kind of work—bureaucratic or knowledge production”

If we fail to remember more than the official story—if we accede to the account where the dominant culture simply “came around,” in Schulman’s words—we lose more than historical accuracy. We lose the understanding that our own reality is the product of passionate struggle. We fail to honor the people who loved the possibilities of changed futures enough to work toward them even while they were themselves dying. We repudiate the interdependence and coconstitution required for memory projects that can do justice to the past we have inherited. We lose sight of how we might, in our own present, take queer responsibility for shaping different presents and more livable futures. And, perhaps centrally for this discussion, we let slip that insight that medicine, like memory, is political and never pure—and thus is something for which we can collectively take responsibility. The queer work of remembering for the future centers the possibility of remembering this kind of reclassificatory work as a promise for worlds to come.

I forecast here a network of understandings of interdependence that I will unpack further in chapter 6, where I argue for disability interdependencies as a key for crafting different futures. There, I draw on certain Indigenous, Buddhist, and disability-theory conceptions of interdependence.

In this chapter, I take an approach to the toxic present grounded in conceptions of queer relationality.

I can understand, though we can be in relation to one another, with attention. But the stories we tell about them continue to be interesting.

This is an extremely specific and local example, and honestly in the context of how deeply messed up the land and water of Sudbury are, it feels very minor.

If we want to have more adequate understandings of the world, we need ways to talk about why atrazine and other chemicals used in industrial food production might be bad for us and the world that do not rely on the assumption that sexual bodily transformations, nonstraight sexuality, and disabil-ity are wrongs that must be avoided.
LOCATION: 1701

The dance of agency between human and nonhuman agents also happens at a more intimate level. The boundaries between our flesh and the flesh of the world we are of and in is porous. While that porosity is what allows us to flourish—as we breathe in the oxygen we need to survive and metabolize the nutrients out of which our flesh emerges—this porosity often does not discriminate against that which can kill us. We cannot survive without water and food, but their viscous porosity often binds itself to strange and toxic bedfellows.
LOCATION: 1742

Considering industrial offcasts (easily understood as pollutants) and substances like atrazine (a chemical framed as useful, harmless, and only in some contexts legible as harmful), we might find that they are more easily analytically than practically separable. As Tuana puts it, “There is a viscous porosity of flesh—my flesh and the flesh of the world. This porosity is a hinge through which we are of and in the world. I refer to it as viscous, for there are membranes that effect the interactions. These membranes of various types—skin and flesh, prejudgments and symbolic imaginaries, habits and embodiments” (199–200). Because of the ways materials in the world are taken into our body, the fact that there is always only a complex system that we name collectively “a human” becomes a little more obviously coconstituted.3

the world that Tsing calls an art of noticing (Tsing 2015). I regard this kind of attunement as a rich resource for countering the dangers I have identified above: using frogs and toads as merely indicator species for potential human dangers and falling into harmful tropes

I think that’s kind of what all of my interest in learning things and learning the names of things and stuff like that is really, just about seeing things differently and they’re somehow—learning what the Latin name for a particular thing is—sort of makes you see it differently. And, it, it stands out from the landscape in a particular way. I think because you start to notice the uniqueness of the creature, the uniqueness of the species . . . and so, the world comes into a sharper focus.

that humans have responsibilities. As Kier argues: “The point in interrogating these classificatory infrastructures, in order to de-centre the human, is not to put animals or other things on a pedestal or to include them, but to begin to map our interdependencies in larger systems of relational re/production. To simply include or valorize non-humans would deny the obligations humans bear as complexly thinking animals capable of solving some of the major social and ecological problems we’ve created”

Toxicity is not only about invisible chemicals that cause transformations in the breeding capacity of frogs—it is also about bullfrogs eating tree frogs, or transmitting fungal infections to them. How can we attend to those conditions for the living and dying of amphibious friends?

Astrid Schrader has articulated the kind of attention following from the form of attention, which I have followed Tsing in thinking of as an “art of noticing on a damaged planet” as a practice of nonteleological care. Such care “articulates a relation to the other and a mode of attention” (Schrader n.d., 5). In a piece reflecting on teaching the Chernobyl entry in Raffles’s book, Schrader persuasively argues that Hesse-Honegger is able to perceive and think about a biological situation unthinkable by conventional scientists—she is able to “perceive the unexpected”—as “part of her technology of care, a particular mode of attention. In systematically complementing precision with randomness, Hesse-Honegger’s self-withdrawal is no longer opposable to judgments about the exposure of deformities, but becomes its condition of possibility, such that the insect may contribute to its visible renderings”
LOCATION: 1920

One way to think about the ethical implication of embodiment is thus: that we have bodies means that we must sustain them—we must eat, and we must maintain a physical situation that allows us to stay alive (we must use energy). Embodiment as a form of implication means that to live, we rely on others intimately—we use them, and our actions shape the conditions for their lives and deaths. Here, “use” often means “kill.” Our eating bodies have permeable boundaries and unstable, dynamic relations with taking in nourishment and expelling waste.
LOCATION: 1963

If we orient toward eating as though we can personally exempt ourselves from ethical or physical ill-effects, we’re engaging in a perpetually failing purity project.
LOCATION: 2077

But all ways that we orient ourselves in relation to eating are also ways to place ourselves in material and immaterial systems that on some level we understand to be in play. The tomato we eat was a seed, then a sprout. It was planted by someone, and it relied on either a complex living web of microbes, insects, clay, humus, sunlight, water, or perhaps a complex web of petroleum derivatives, presterilized fields, seeds with fish DNA spliced in, sunlight, and water. Someone picked it, someone packed it, someone drove it around, someone placed a sticker on it, someone weighed it and told us how much it would cost to buy. When we bite into the tomato, we bite all of that and more
LOCATION: 2082

We should understand eating as illuminating our bodies as mere way stations in complex, entwined systems. The eating and excreting body is always entangled, enmeshed, a mess.
LOCATION: 2095

“because eating and killing cannot be hygienically separated does not mean that just any way of eating and killing is fine, merely a matter of taste and culture. Multispecies human and nonhuman ways of living and dying are at stake in practices of eating” (Haraway 2008, 295). Relationality does not imply relativism, but instead practices of responsibility.
LOCATION: 2152

agree with Probyn about the idea that in eating we are placed in relation to others, and that bodies shape our horizon of ethics. But I believe that there is no such entity as “the body,” or that the body is never only the body: when we understand eating, or energy use, we understand the otherness we carry within, the interdependence of existence.
LOCATION: 2198

And yet there is no obvious reason for us to take mammals or fish or even bees as the bright line at which we make an agential ethical cut, bringing them into the fold of our moral regard. The tiny black flies who pollinate blueberries and bite humans avoid death if they can, and worms churned up when the plow comes through to seed vegetable crops seem certainly to be the experiencing subjects of some kind of life. Why should we accord the cow more moral standing than the worm? And, reprising Hird’s provocation about the potential ethical standing of bacteria, how would we act appropriately in relation to the bacteria that constitute the conditions of our lives? Here the inclination toward purity enacted through diet breaks against the intractable reality that death and life are entangled, just as our lives are dependent on others.
LOCATION: 2205

I agree; but it is not clear to me that anything is ours to abuse in the relevant sense. And yet, to live, we do use and consume all sorts of other beings. I doubt that humans have or should have any relationship of ownership with plants, ecosystems, or even our own microbiome—and yet, to live, we do definitely have relations of use, and direct or indirect consumption of beings who would prefer not be consumed. In my own eating practice and in theory, I am interested in pursuing forms of noninnocent responsibility that do not rest on the lie that we can step outside relations of entanglement that are also always relations of suffering.

Heldke offers instead the formulation of understanding “foods not as substances, but loci of relations,” arguing that “ethical decision making would be better facilitated by an ontological shift in the way we think about food—a shift that emphasizes the relational nature of food-and-us” (70).

If we follow Kant and others, judgments of beauty in turn tell us who is part of the collective “we” can understand as “us,” who has access to dignity and respect.

It is perhaps most effective, then, to use aesthetic forms to directly alter the conditions of judgment, to claim beauty in the face of invisibility.

They move beyond critique of ablism, classism, sexism, heteronormativity, racialization, gender binaries, and more, and into a mode of being as becoming. Being as becoming involves active engagement with collective modes of interdependent, agential subjectivity. Agency here shows up in how we navigate the micropractices of power woven through our lives: changing documentation, getting a place to live, having a place at work to use the washroom, being legible and desirable and desiring. These micropractices are sites of friction for people oppressed by dominant forms of life grounded in the ideal of voluntarist individualism. Through challenges to open normativities, the disciplinary force of normalization is loosened; we create and take up new norms and proliferate visions of ways of being that are worth taking up.

We are interested not in race and gender (and class and sexuality and disability) per se, by themselves, but primarily as they have been acknowledged as conditions for hierarchies of power, so that we can transform them into intertwined vectors of struggle for freedom. When we identify into feminism, we mean new epistemologies, new ways of producing knowledge and transforming social relations. As scholars and activists, we realize that categories always fall short of the social realities they attempt to represent, and social realities always exceed the categories that attempt to contain them.

Davis is talking specifically about identifying into feminism as an uneasy but usable political move. Necessarily, the feminism one identifies into cannot be the same as identifying completely with already existing feminism, because feminism as a body of work—not only the world it aims to transform—is imperfect and frequently a huge problem.

I’m insisting on a praxis as the sign under which we talk about identifying into because it matters both what understanding we hold (our theory) and what we do (our practice).

Dixon specifies, though, that it is important to resist understanding prefigurative practices in a general or theoretical way, and in his work he teases apart four different senses of this concept: (1) Lifestylist attempts to live one’s values; (2) Working on institutions that can counter existing, unjust institutional forms; (3) Horizontal organizing that builds capacity; and, finally, (4) Being good to each other (85).

Speculative futures can prefigure a practice that welcomes the selves to come. This orientation toward futures to come is grounded in the experience of interdependence, politically organized around the idea of identifying into a world that we create starting from our speculation that it could be otherwise than it is. Shaping our identities out of our politics includes understanding the history that has shaped our field of possibility as a site for identification. The new world we carry in our hearts is always a world grounded in the actually existing present in all its impurity, responsible to the past in all its complexity. Just as we are differentially responsible to the past and present, we are differentially situated in relation to worlds we can identify into—power never disappears.
