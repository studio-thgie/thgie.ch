**The Posthuman**

**Rosi Braidotti**

-   We assert our attachment to the species as if it were a matter of fact, a given. So much so that we construct a fundamental notion of Rights around the Human.

> [[Location: 86]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=86)

-   the posthuman condition introduces a qualitative shift in our thinking about what exactly is the basic unit of common reference for our species, our polity and our relationship to the other inhabitants of this planet.

> [[Location: 92]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=92)

-   In my view, the common denominator for the posthuman condition is an assumption about the vital, self-organizing and yet non-naturalistic structure of living matter itself.

-   My point is that this approach, which rests on the binary opposition between the given and the constructed, is currently being replaced by a non-dualistic understanding of nature--culture interaction. In my view the latter is associated to and supported by a monistic philosophy, which rejects dualism, especially the opposition nature--culture and stresses instead the self-organizing (or auto-poietic) force of living matter.

> [[Location: 115]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=115)

-   The main questions I want to address in this book are: firstly what is the posthuman? More specifically, what are the intellectual and historical itineraries that may lead us to the posthuman? Secondly: where does the posthuman condition leave humanity? More specifically, what new forms of subjectivity are supported by the posthuman? Thirdly: how does the posthuman engender its own forms of inhumanity? More specifically, how might we resist the inhuman(e) aspects of our era? And last, how does the posthuman affect the practice of the Humanities today? More specifically, what is the function of theory in posthuman times?

-   posthuman theory is a generative tool to help us re-think the basic unit of reference for the human in the bio-genetic age known as 'anthropocene', the historical moment when the Human has become a geological force capable of affecting all life on this planet.

-   This book is not about taking sides in academic disputes, but rather aims to make sense of the complexities we find ourselves in.

-   Subjectivity is equated with consciousness, universal rationality, and self-regulating ethical behaviour, whereas Otherness is defined as its negative and specular counterpart.

-   Humanism's restricted notion of what counts as the human is one of the keys to understand how we got to a post-human turn at all.

> [[Location: 320]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=320)

-   The human of Humanism is neither an ideal nor an objective statistical average or middle ground. It rather spells out a systematized standard of recognizability -- of Sameness -- by which all others can be assessed, regulated and allotted to a designated social location. The human is a normative convention, which does not make it inherently negative, just highly regulatory and hence instrumental to practices of exclusion and discrimination. The human norm stands for normality, normalcy and normativity.

-   to replace it with a more complex and relational subject framed by embodiment, sexuality, affectivity, empathy and desire as core qualities.

> [[Location: 498]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=498)

-   For me it is impossible, both intellectually and ethically, to disengage the positive elements of Humanism from their problematic counterparts: individualism breeds egotism and self-centredness; self-determination can turn to arrogance and domination; and science is not free from its own dogmatic tendencies.

-   I have great respect for deconstruction, but also some impatience with the limitations of its linguistic frame of reference. I prefer to take a more materialist route to deal with the complexities of the posthuman as a key feature of our historicity.

> [[Location: 568]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=568)

-   A post-secular approach, posited on firm anti-humanist grounds makes manifest the previously unacceptable notion that rational agency and political subjectivity, can actually be conveyed through and supported by religious piety and may even involve significant amounts of spirituality. Belief systems and their rituals are perhaps not incompatible with critical thought and practices of citizenship.

> [[Location: 641]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=641)

-   Subjectivity is rather a process of auto-poiesis or self-styling, which involves complex and continuous negotiations with dominant norms and values and hence also multiple forms of accountability (Braidotti, 2006).

> [[Location: 649]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=649)

-   Posthumanism is the historical moment that marks the end of the opposition between Humanism and anti-humanism and traces a different discursive framework, looking more affirmatively towards new alternatives.

> [[Location: 676]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=676)

-   The posthumanist perspective rests on the assumption of the historical decline of Humanism but goes further in exploring alternatives, without sinking into the rhetoric of the crisis of Man.

-   Thirdly, I note that the advocates of advanced capitalism seem to be faster in grasping the creative potential of the posthuman than some of the well-meaning and progressive neo-humanist opponents of this system.

-   In my own work, I define the critical posthuman subject within an eco-philosophy of multiple belongings, as a relational subject constituted in and by multiplicity, that is to say a subject that works across differences and is also internally differentiated, but still grounded and accountable.

> [[Location: 884]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=884)

-   Posthuman subjectivity expresses an embodied and embedded and hence partial form of accountability, based on a strong sense of collectivity, relationality and hence community building.

-   The project of developing a new kind of post-nationalist nomadic European identity is certainly challenging in that it requires dis-identification from established, nation-bound identities.

> [[Location: 963]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=963)

-   Instead of falling back on the sedimented habits of thought that the humanist past has institutionalized, the posthuman predicament encourages us to undertake a leap forward into the complexities and paradoxes of our times. To meet this task, new conceptual creativity is needed.

> [[Location: 974]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=974)

-   Mary Evans was a woman of many talents and anyone who ever identified with Dorothea in Middlemarch (1973) or Maggie in The Mill on the Floss (2003) may not be cognitively aware of the fact that s/he stepped -- surreptitiously and fatally -- into a monistic universe of intersecting affective relations that simply make the world go round.

> [[Location: 1006]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=1006)

-   Vitalist materialism is a concept that helps us make sense of that external dimension, which in fact enfolds within the subject as the internalized score of cosmic vibrations (Deleuze, 1992; Deleuze and Guattari, 1994). It also constitutes the core of a posthuman sensibility that aims at overcoming anthropocentrism.

> [[Location: 1014]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=1014)

-   These monistic premises are for me the building blocks for a posthuman theory of subjectivity that does not rely on classical Humanism and carefully avoids anthropocentrism. The classical emphasis on the unity of all matter, which is central to Spinoza, is reinforced by an updated scientific understanding of the self-organizing or 'smart' structure of living matter. These ideas are supported by new advances in contemporary biosciences, neural and cognitive sciences and by the informatics sector. Posthuman subjects are technologically mediated to an unprecedented degree.

> [[Location: 1030]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=1030)

-   In this chapter I want to argue that the issue of the posthuman in relation to post-anthropocentrism is of an altogether different order than in post-humanism. For one thing, whereas the latter mobilized primarily the disciplinary field of philosophy, history, cultural studies and the classical Humanities in general, the issue of post-anthropocentrism enlists also science and technology studies, new media and digital culture, environmentalism and earth-sciences, bio-genetics, neuroscience and robotics, evolutionary theory, critical legal theory, primatology, animal rights and science fiction. This high degree of trans-disciplinarity alone adds an extra layer of complexity to the issue.

-   These non-profit experiments with contemporary subjectivity actualize the virtual possibilities of an expanded, relational self that functions in a nature--culture continuum and is technologically mediated.

-   Asserting a vital bond between the humans and other species is both necessary and fine. This bond is negative in that it is the effect of shared vulnerability, which is itself a consequence of human actions upon the environment.

-   Firstly, it confirms the binary distinction human/animal by benevolently extending the hegemonic category, the human, towards the others. Secondly, it denies the specificity of animals altogether, because it uniformly takes them as emblems of the trans-species, universal ethical value of empathy.

-   As such, I am a she-wolf, a breeder that multiplies cells in all directions; I am an incubator and a carrier of vital and lethal viruses; I am mother-earth, the generator of the future. In the political economy of phallogocentrism and of anthropocentric humanism, which predicates the sovereignty of Sameness in a falsely universalistic mode, my sex fell on the side of 'Otherness', understood as pejorative difference, or as being-worth-less-than. The becoming-posthuman speaks to my feminist self, partly because my sex, historically speaking, never quite made it into full humanity, so my allegiance to that category is at best negotiable and never to be taken for granted.

> [[Location: 1511]{.underline}](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00DXK354M&location=1511)

-   Species equality in a post-anthropocentric world does urge us to question the violence and the hierarchical thinking that result from human arrogance and the assumption of transcendental human exceptionalism. In my view, monistic relationality stresses instead the more compassionate aspect of subjectivity.

-   One's view on death depends on one's assumptions about Life. In my vitalist materialist view, Life is cosmic energy, simultaneously empty chaos and absolute speed or movement. It is impersonal and inhuman in the monstrous, animal sense of radical alterity: zoe in all its powers. This does not mean that zoe, or life as absolute vitality, is not above negativity, because it can hurt.

-   My vitalist notion of death is that it is the inhuman within us, which frees us into life. Each of us is always already a 'has been', as we are mortal beings. Desire as the ontological drive to become (potentia) seduces us into going on living. If sustained long enough, life becomes a habit. If the habit becomes self-fulfilling, life becomes addictive, which is the opposite of necessary or self-evident.

-   Self-styling one's death is an act of affirmation because it means cultivating an approach, a 'style' of life that progressively and continuously fixes the modalities and the stage for the final act, leaving nothing un-attended.

-   Remember that this is a secular discourse, generated by a critical theory that wants to think to the end the nature--culture continuum within a monistic ontology that considers all matter as intelligent and self-organizing. Recognizing this continuum makes us able to be worthy of all that happens to us: amor fati being the pragmatic acknowledgment that the posthuman subject is the expression of successive waves of becoming, fuelled by zoe as the ontological motor. It is neither human nor divine, but relentless material and vowed to multi-directional and cross-species relationality. Life does go on, relentlessly non-human in the vital force that animates it.

-   Affirmation, not nostalgia, is the road to pursue: not the idealization of philosophical meta-discourse, but the more pragmatic task of self-transformation through humble experimentation. Let me expand on this project in the next section.

-   My golden rules are: cartography accuracy, with the corollary of ethical accountability; trans-disciplinarity; the importance of combining critique with creative figurations; the principle of non-linearity; the powers of memory and the imagination and the strategy of de-familiarization. These methodological guidelines are valuable not only as building blocks for posthuman critical theory but also because they can help redefine the relationship between the Humanities and the Life sciences on the basis of mutual respect.

-   For example, figurations such as the feminist/the womanist/the queer/the cyborg/the diasporic, native, nomadic subjects, as well as oncomouse and Dolly the sheep are no mere metaphors, but signposts for specific geo-political and historical locations. As such, they express complex singularities, not universal claims (Braidotti, 2011a).

-   consequently need to adopt non-linearity to develop cartographies of power that account for the paradoxes of the posthuman era.

-   The unbearable lightness of being falls upon us as soon as we start running with zoe; non-human life itself. Nomadic theory's vital geo-centrism -- the love of zoe -- is a parallel effort in the same direction.

-   In other words, vital materialism does not assume an over-arching concept of life, just practices and flows of becoming, complex assemblages and heterogeneous relations.

-   In some ways, the technologically smart urban space displaces and replaces the university, by inscribing knowledge and its circulation at the heart of the social order.

-   More Internet-backed interactivity will allow citizens to participate in all forms of planning, managing and assessing their urban environment. The key words are: open source, open governance, open data and open science, granting free access by the public to all scientific and administrative data. Contemporary twenty-first-century cities, as in the case of the Chinese study quoted above, are not only sprawled out or 'exploded' urban spaces. They are also -- in the best of cases -- technologically mediated, 'smart' urban surfaces.

-   Because of the high degree of technological intervention involved in contemporary network societies, this new urban space can be considered as post-anthropocentric and well beyond the Vitruvian frame of reference of a humanist scale.

-   The cities of tomorrow will be living centres of learning, information brokering and shared cognitive practice, based on intense social networking. After naval ports and airports, Internet ports will be the gateways to navigating the cities of the third millennium.

-   Academics are left to brokering ideas, while information networks do the content provision and are increasingly autonomous in decision making. All around, an exploded and expanded 'smart' city space distributes the knowledge products to students-users who are literate in infrastructural knowledge production. Welcome to the future!

-   The posthuman nomadic subject is materialist and vitalist, embodied and embedded -- it is firmly located somewhere, according to the radical immanence of the 'politics of location' that I have stressed throughout this book. It is a multi-faceted and relational subject, conceptualized within a monistic ontology, through the lenses of Spinoza, Deleuze and Guattari, plus feminist and post-colonial theories. It is a subject actualized by the relational vitality and elemental complexity that mark posthuman thought itself.

-   Life, simply by being life, expresses itself by actualizing flows of energies, through codes of vital information across complex somatic, cultural and technologically networked systems.

-   Becoming-posthuman consequently is a process of redefining one's sense of attachment and connection to a shared world, a territorial space: urban, social, psychic, ecological, planetary as it may be.

-   For posthuman theory, the subject is a transversal entity, fully immersed in and immanent to a network of non-human (animal, vegetable, viral) relations. The zoe-centred embodied subject is shot through with relational linkages of the contaminating/viral kind which inter-connect it to a variety of others, starting from the environmental or eco-others and include the technological apparatus.

-   What if, by comparison with the immanent know-how of animals, conscious self-representation were blighted by narcissistic delusions of transcendence and consequently blinded by its own aspirations to self-transparency?

-   This is a new situation we find ourselves in: the immanent here and now of a posthuman planet. It is one of the possible worlds we have made for ourselves, and in so far as it is the result of our joint efforts and collective imaginings, it is quite simply the best of all possible posthuman worlds.
