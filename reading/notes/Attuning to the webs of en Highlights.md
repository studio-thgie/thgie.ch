Like a hunter wandering in a forest, tracing faint signs of game, tact entails trying to sense the reasons of nonhuman orders. To respond to the slightest sign, the hunter must wait while searching, all the while staying attentive to the motions and sounds of the world. Thus, tact can be seen as the limit point where that which one has consciously learned encounters worldly surprises that go beyond this learning.

To respond to the slightest sign, the hunter must wait while searching, all the while staying attentive to the motions and sounds of the world. Thus, tact can be seen as the limit point where that which one has consciously learned encounters worldly surprises that go beyond this learning.

however, Minakatas tact was not an antonym of reason. Instead, the intensified attention indexed by tact enabled a sense of wonder and mystery, which was integral to an expanded reason. This ontological tact resonates with Whiteheads (1920: 163) observation that delicacy of sense-apprehension means perception of objects as distinct entities, which are mere subtle ideas to cruder sensibilities.

As a living mandala, webs of en are at once transitory actualizations and immanent reasons of the great mystery. Contingent, and charged with transformative potential, this is anything but a static scheme of being. Rather than positing a fixed, dual relation between humans and divinities, depending on circumstantial arrangements almost everything may turn out to be either divine or mundane.[164]
