People form intimate relationships with their Roombas. I found the term and process of Roombarization especially interesting. I describes the effort and practice of preparing the space for the Roomba in order for it to not malfunction or have it easier to do its job. The paper crystalizes and supports four design implications of interests.

*Form follows function?*
The Roomba was not built to imitate bio life in order for the user to form an intimate relationship with it.

*Intimacy through ambiguity*
The Roomba's actions and functions needed to be explorer by the users and could not easily be predicted. This on is similar to Betti Marenko's design principle of **uncertainty** [@marenkoAnimisticDesignHow2016].

*Intimacy through accountability*
The user saw into the workings of the Roomba by being able to directly see it do its job.

*Intimacy through support*
Roomba directly support its users, especially in terms of social values or if the users had disabilities.
