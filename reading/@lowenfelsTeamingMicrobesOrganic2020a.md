# Teaming with microbes

There are plenty of microbes in the soil, if it was not chemically treated. The microbes build a food-web amongst each other. 

Bacteria and fungi are mainly interested in the exudates from the plant roots, which are carbohydrates and some minerals. These microbes are eaten by nematodes and xyz who then proceed to poop what they donâ€™t digest. These excrement are in turn taken up by the plant roots, since they contain valuable micro-nutrients and minerals. 

- Bacteria and fungi are part of why soil keeps structure through bacterial slime and fungi hyphae
- Soil life keep nutrients in the sign through locking it up in their own bodies
- Soil life diversity keeps diseases and bad actants from overtaking
- Nitrogen can be found in the soil in the form of ammonium or nitrate. Fungi prefer ammonium while bacteria prefer nitrate. 
- Because chemical fertilisers and other add-ons cater mainly to bacteria and disturb the food web the whole balance of the soil is disturbed

Only about 10% of the surface of earth is soil. Soil is more or less made out of 45% minerals, 5% organic materials and the rest is hummus. What the meaning of micro particles and molecules come into being through physical and chemical processes by which larger rocks are decayed. The important thing about hummus  is that it consists of a chains of carbon molecules. These molecules allow water or air to be attached to them. Both of which are essential for soil life. 

- There is a thing called soil profile and horizons. These indicate layers in the soil, which can be distinguished for example, by the amount of organic matter that they contain and in which state this matter is.
- Soil colour is often an indicator of the composition of the soil. Four as gardeners soil should have the colour of dark coffee. 
- Soil texture is defined by clay, silt and sand. These three categories indicate particle size but not what element the particles are made of. A good soil should be a more or less equal mix of the three categories. They are important because they have different surface areas and can hold water and air in different ways.

Exercise: take the top 30 cm of soil mix them with 2 cups of water and a tablespoon of water softer noon. Shake vigourously, and wait for 24 hours until the particles settled in their respective layers.
