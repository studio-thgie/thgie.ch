Basically, Escobar wants to move from a historically euro-centric design to a design for the pluriverse, an autonomous design, inspired by the Zapatistas and other epistemologies of the south how arise out of struggles for autonomy.

> "Un Mundo Donde Quepan Muchos Mundos."

In his first two chapters, he analyses the current design discourse on it's potential to move towards a true transition design and from there on. Towards the end he tackles several interesting and critical subjects.

- Feminist Political Ecology (FPE und PE)
- Political Ontology (PO)
- post-dualism and the ontological turn [p.63]
- negofeminism, expanded ecological self of deep ecology
- designers as nepantheras [p.65]
- Epistemologies of the South (ES) by Boaventura de Sousa Santos

Important is his opposition to the one-world-world (OWW) a concept that stands for the euro-centric epistemologies (white, patriarchic) that has all the attributes of colonialism and capitalism. 

There is political struggle and resistance between the ancestral pluriverse and the OWW which tries to economically, politically and militarily dominate the south.

> "El territoria es la vida y la vida no se vende, se ama y se defiende."

This amongst other things lead to the second important concept of autonomous design, namely community or the communal.
