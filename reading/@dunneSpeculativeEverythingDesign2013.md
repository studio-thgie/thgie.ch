# Speculative Everything
#reading-notes 

## Voices
There is a notion of collectiveness, but not very clearly defined. The assumption of inclusiveness is an error of the privileged. In general the authors speak of _designers_ and _design practices_ and never reflect much, who those could be. A reflection on the privilege of time and resources to follow speculative design practices is missing. 

Although talking of society and inclusiveness they advocate to work with specialists in their respective fields (ethicists, political scientists, economists), instead of with those, who are actually concerned with the implications of design.

An interesting debate on the issue for and by whom speculative design is made, watch this discussion between Ahmed Ansari and Jamer Hunt.

Throughout the reviewed chapters (1 and 5) many references to artists are made.

## Discourse
Speculative design sees itselve as a continuation of radical design and in this they position themselves rather anti-capitalist and their design practice as political activity.

## Summary

In the first chapter, titled _Beyond Radical Design_, Fiona Raby and Anthony Dunne advocate for the importance of design to imagine alternative futures. They make the point, that imaginative, social, and political speculation became more difficult since radical design and trace that cause to changes in global politics as well as capitalism.

> […] we need more pluralism in design, not of style but of ideology and values. p. 9

## Chapter 5 - A Methodological Playground: Fictional Worlds and Thought Experiments
Already early on in the book, the authors promote looking at other artistic disciplines for inspiration on how to speculate and create fictions.

> To find inspiration for speculating through design we need to look beyond design to the methodological playgrounds of cinema, literature, science, ethics, politics, and art; to explore, hybridize, borrow, and embrace the many tools available for crafting not only things but also ideas—fictional worlds, cautionary tales, what-if scenarios, thought experiments, counterfactuals, reductio ad absurdum experiments, prefigurative futures, and so on. [@dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013, 3]

In the fifth chapter they briefly examine said disciplines on their potential to serve for inspiration. In their analysis literature as well as fine arts seem to be the most promising to serve the intended purpose. As many disciplines already have a rich discourse on _fictionalism_, they already have categories to distinct between what is real and what is not real. In design these categories would be _the actual_ and _the fictional_.

The rest of the chapter is committed to the exploration of possible methods for speculation with examples of where they're found in other disciplines.

### Utopia/Dystopia

The concepts of utopia/dystopia should be used as a stimulus, to keep ideas alive, not to actually realize them top down (like dictatorships) in order to measure life as it is, to how it could be.

### Extrapolation: Neoliberal Speculative Fiction

Most thought-provoking utopias/dystopias are extrapolations of free market soscieties, for example the works of Philip K. Dick and many others in literature. Cinematic approaches seem to be weaker in this, as they have to reduce aesthetics to known tropes. Design then should position itself in between literature (complete imagination) and cinema (visual tropes).

### Ideas as Stories

Speculative design is interested in ideas that the viewer can use to imagine  the kind of society that would have produced them, its values, beliefs, and ideologies. Margaret Atwood's novels are a good example of speculative design: based on actual research and then extrapolated while more interested in the social, cultural, and ethical implications of science and technology than the technology itself.

>  For us, she is the gold standard for speculative work—based on real science; focused on social, cultural, ethical, and political implications; interested in using stories to aid reflection; yet without sacrificing the quality of storytelling or literary aspects of her work. [@dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013, 78]

One more aspect is how rich and thought-provoking fictional worlds can be developed from
idiosyncratic starting points.

### Thought Experiments

The speculative approach could or should be seen as thought-experiments, not necessarily narratives or coherent world-building, which makes them closer to conceptual art then conventional design. It's important to focus on the thought part, not just the experiment itself

#### Reduction Ad Absurdum

Absurdly reducing one idea to one single aspect. Thomas Twaites _[The Toaster Project](http://www.thetoasterproject.org/)_ is discussed.

#### Counterfactuals

Another approach for speculation is the changing of a historical fact to see how the present would have changed. The _Attenborough Design Group_ is discussed in which sustainability and emotional ties were product through the implementation of animal like behavior in electronic artifacts.

#### What-Ifs

This method is closely related to _counterfactuals_, but more foreward looking. How could the changing of a thing from the present influence the future.

### Fictioneers in Denial

The last part of this chapter discusses how the fictiol still seems to be someting _bad_ for designers, while they're actually involved in the creation of many fictions in their design practices. The authors advocate to liberate the fiction-making from the industry to serve society.

> We are interested in liberating this story making (not storytelling) potential, this dream-materializing ability, from purely commercial applications and redirecting it toward more social ends that address the citizen rather than the consumer or perhaps both at the same time. p. 88
