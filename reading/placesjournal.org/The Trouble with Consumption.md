## Page Notes
## Highlights
- In other words, a counter-consumerist ethic and politics should appeal not only to altruistic compassion and environmental concern (as in the case of Fair Trade and ethical shopping), but also to the self-regarding gratifications of living and consuming differently. It can seek democratic anchorage and legitimation in the already existing resistance to consumer culture. At a time when some economic theorists predict a terminal decline in capitalism’s powers of accumulation, 4 and when the environmental obstacles to growth appear insuperable, it becomes urgent to renew an earlier tradition of positive thinking on the liberation from work, and in this way to strengthen an alternative hedonist defense of the pleasures of a less harried and acquisitive way of living. — [Updated on 2020-12-26 11:43:10](https://hyp.is/JYNnXkdnEeu7E7Md9034aA/placesjournal.org/article/alternative-hedonism-and-the-trouble-with-consumption/) — Group: #Public
