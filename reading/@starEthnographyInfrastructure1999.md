# The Ethnography of Infrastructure
    
-   What exactly must be studied in order to study infrastructure?
    

**Theorizing System development across time and space**

-   Invisibility
-   Dependence on human practices
-   Modularity (one piece of infrastructure is never really under the control of one single actant)
-   Standardization
-   Momentum
    

_Some Notes_

**Infrastructure Properties**

-   Embeddedness
-   Transparency
-   Reach or scope
-   Learned as part of membership
-   Links with conventions of practice
-   Embodiment of standards
-   Built on an installed base
-   Becomes visible upon breakdown
-   Is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally
    

**Tricks of the trade**

-   Identifying master narratives and “others”
-   Surfacing invisible work
-   Paradoxes of infrastructure
    

**Reading information infrastructure**

-   as a material artifact (physical and pragmatic properties)
-   as a trace or record of activities (information collecting device, assistant and cultural artifact)
-   as a veridical representation of the world
