## Page Notes
## Highlights
- All of this emphasises a fundamental point about clarifying your thinking. It asks you to admit your thoughts are unclear to begin with – and thus, that certain elements within them need to be rethought, or placed upon more secure foundations. It’s as if you’re shedding layers of preconception, misconception and false consciousness. And the ultimate prize isn’t being right, gratifying though this might be. It’s being understood. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 07:44:00](https://hyp.is/Bc6LXMp4Eeu_0dPbu9oekA/psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication) — Group: #Public

- We all carry around countless unclear, confused, contradictory thoughts and feelings. And precisely because we have neither the time nor the tools to sort them out, they mostly stay this way. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 07:46:57](https://hyp.is/b3KPGMp4EeuaUE95t_7mbA/psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: I feel like I address this in my practices of reflection, but I also have the feeling, that I loose a lot of thoughts there, somewhere in the depths of my tools or practices.
- If I want to clarify my thinking around this issue, I need to investigate the divide between my apparent beliefs and my actions. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 07:49:36](https://hyp.is/zcHRAMp4EeuWoreel-7gmQ/psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication) — Group: #Public

- While common understanding and meaningful disagreement might sound like opposites, they’re actually two sides of the same coin. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 07:51:16](https://hyp.is/CcZMOsp5Eeu03Yt_x83ZmA/psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication) — Group: #Public

- Our assumptions, in other words, aren’t just unexamined ideas. They’re also the roots of identity and allegiance; the stuff of our personal and shared histories; of our communities and our morality.  — [Updated on 2021-06-11 07:51:59](https://hyp.is/I2sZVMp5EeuvqHeL22jTZg/psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication) — Group: #Public

- When it comes to clarifying your thinking, it means that you need to be very clear about the difference between what follows from your assumptions and the status of those assumptions. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 07:52:20](https://hyp.is/L97AyMp5EeugJVsSMiSdxw/psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication) — Group: #Public

- This, I’d suggest, is the most precious thing about clearly presenting the thinking behind any point of view: not that it proves your rightness or righteousness, but that it volunteers your willingness to participate in a reasoned exchange of ideas. — [Updated on 2021-06-11 07:54:44](https://hyp.is/hVqk1sp5EeuqjxtOpHGUPQ/psyche.co/guides/how-to-think-clearly-to-improve-understanding-and-communication) — Group: #Public
