# Animism: A Love Story for Longevity

- she is argueing that animism in design has the potential to create caring relationships, but doesn't necessary. she cites the case of the river Yamuna, which is whorshipped as a Goddess, but still is abused. even after the river got achieved legal personhood.
- she then goes into two speculative scenarios
  - through animism…
  - …would our design processes be less wasteful?
  - …would we be more inclined to associate quality with regifting previously loved objects instead of relying on buying new ones?
- the link to animism is present, but weak in my opinion as it is missing clear examples. it's mostly expressed in the text through, what if we would show care and love to objects and materials, as we do with people or pets that are close to us.
