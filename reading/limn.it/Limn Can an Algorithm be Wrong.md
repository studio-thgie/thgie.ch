## Page Notes
## Highlights
- It suggests, first, that many are deeply invested in the Twitter network as a political tool, and that some worry that Twitter’s interests might be aligned with the financial and political status quo they hope to challenge. — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:36:24](https://hyp.is/Il92YD5OEeyrGFeS1dlNIA/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public

- These providers offer complex algorithms to manage, curate, and organize these massive networks. But there is a tension between what we understand these algorithms to be, what we need them to be, and what they in fact are. We do not have a sufficient vocabulary for assessing the intervention of these algorithms. We’re not adept at appreciating what it takes to design a tool like Trends – one that appears to effortlessly identify what’s going on, yet also makes distinct and motivated choices. We don’t have a language for the unexpected associations algorithms make, beyond the intention (or even comprehension) of their designers (Ananny 2011). — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:36:37](https://hyp.is/Kei3_D5OEeyQgtNcS-YByg/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public

- Most importantly, we have not fully recognized how these algorithms attempt to produce representations of the wants or concerns of the public, and as such, run into the classic problem of political representation: who claims to know the mind of the public, and how do they claim to know it? — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:37:25](https://hyp.is/RrFblj5OEeyrY5dRsLS8Jw/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: But do they want to represent the wants or concerns of the public?
- Twitter has repeatedly stated that their Trends algorithm is not a simple measure of volume — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:41:02](https://hyp.is/yDNrAD5OEey_TJsMQHmipQ/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: It doesn't help then, that they add the amount of tweets with a given # then. There is a problem of explaining the inner workings as well.
- For instance, one substantial revision occurred in May 2010 when Twitter announced it was removing Justin Bieber from the Trending Topics list. — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:43:12](https://hyp.is/FWAbCD5PEeyWP-OhCIiv2Q/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: And thus admit they can manually interfere with Trends.
- Twitter Trends is just one of many information practices that claim to know or represent the will of the people: public opinion polls, census surveys, man-on-the-street interviews, voting mechanisms. — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:47:31](https://hyp.is/r5ngAD5PEey8hFPwyNv9LA/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public

- With both of these tensions at work, the politics of the artifact, i.e. the workings of the Trends algorithm, become just one piece of a greater puzzle: the politics of representation. — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:48:08](https://hyp.is/xdPScj5PEey2pm-cVPQb9w/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public

- It claims to know the public through an algorithmic assessment of their complete traces — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:49:18](https://hyp.is/79v_kD5PEey_Uv-W-0EOvQ/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Reminds me of Seeing like an infrastructure by Nick Seavers and how music recommender system measure people only through their interaction with the algorithm.
- But further, the criteria that animate the Trends algorithm also presume a shape and character to the public they intend to measure, and in doing so, help to construct publics in that image. — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:51:29](https://hyp.is/PfqEij5QEeyxhutzluIZXA/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public

- These algorithms produce not barometric readings but hieroglyphs.  At once so clear and so opaque, they beg to be read as reliable measures of the public mind, as signs of “us.” But the shape of the “us” on offer is by no means transparent.  — [Updated on 2021-11-05 16:53:33](https://hyp.is/h9zb6D5QEeyWS2flHj2LlA/limn.it/articles/can-an-algorithm-be-wrong/) — Group: #Public
