## Page Notes
## Highlights
- 5G’s applications extend beyond personal entertainment and other promised benefits for individuals. Its ubiquity and instantaneity will make it possible for groups of people to engage in distant educational opportunities, distributed scientific experiments, and job-training simulations. — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:12:45](https://hyp.is/O_Kw2k3YEeyqDMPD7WTcyg/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- The new network has also been framed as a critical infrastructure for the “smart city.” — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:13:22](https://hyp.is/UejafE3YEeyptcM4mXGppw/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- In short, enhanced connectivity promises accurate, efficient, integrated urban operations. Yet 5G’s rewards, we are told, will radiate far beyond metropolitan areas, delivering robust connectivity to historically underserved markets and rural areas that have never had access to broadband. We can bring the “smart city” to the farm, the refugee camp, and the one-room schoolhouse. — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:14:32](https://hyp.is/e5aZaE3YEeyQwM-6JJJ2gA/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- the advent of 5G will allow entrepreneurs to create new technologies and products that we don’t even know we need yet — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:16:11](https://hyp.is/toxYtE3YEey8stc2KKcLkQ/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: how to see infrastructure like an entrepreneur
- This helps explain why the carriers are so eager for us to share their vision for a better tomorrow — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:17:00](https://hyp.is/wm5Vfk3YEey4qzdNbawgqQ/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: shaping public opinion
- They also, unsurprisingly, fail to ask about the wisdom of entrusting the telecom industry (which has a long history of unscrupulous, monopolistic business practices) and the tech industry (newly under fire for similar reasons) to build what is purportedly the critical infrastructure for a planned global transformation. — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:17:27](https://hyp.is/49eCJk3YEey-wDP3hZYvOA/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- “These lawmakers never anticipated an era [when] communications would need to be designed more like an irrigation system, where connectivity rains down upon its thirsty recipients,” — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:23:21](https://hyp.is/tr17tE3ZEey-xG_oozNuXg/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- “easy access to publicly funded infrastructure at taxpayer-subsidized rates, without any obligation to provide broadband access to underserved residents.” — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:26:44](https://hyp.is/L8ntdk3aEeyvVgfM7olXfQ/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- 5G, we see here, is not just an issue of connectivity and convenience. It’s also about landscape, real estate, aesthetics, public resources, energy, equity, and governance. — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:29:12](https://hyp.is/h-8w2E3aEeyLN1M7dBiJ4w/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- The Chinese government has created infrastructures and incentives to expedite 5G innovation and to deploy Chinese gear (and the web services that run on it) around the world, particularly as part of their Belt and Road Initiative. — [Updated on 2021-11-25 11:31:03](https://hyp.is/ypNx2E3aEeySDtsMgXCapg/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: and politics
- Or, better yet, rather than assume that corporations necessarily provide connectivity, as has historically been the case in the U.S., perhaps we should ask why the internet, today an essential public necessity, shouldn’t instead be a public utility? — [Updated on 2021-11-25 12:38:22](https://hyp.is/MY1omk3kEeyqae_ftouRkQ/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- What we need, Crawford argues, is not 5G as it’s currently blueprinted, but “neutral, open physical [fiber] infrastructure.” Such a system seems unimaginable in the U.S., she suggests, because of “decades of political maneuvering by the enormous private [telecom] companies…, a lack of leadership at the federal level, and the invisibility of this entire policy area.”  — [Updated on 2021-11-25 12:39:03](https://hyp.is/SoGpuk3kEeyrbk-F-lq_MA/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- What’s more, we need to acknowledge how those marketing fantasies and policy scenarios have limited our imaginations. — [Updated on 2021-11-25 12:40:57](https://hyp.is/jmqB9k3kEey-qYP6p20KlQ/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public

- Similar concerns — about invasion and irradiation — have accompanied other new technologies, from electricity to radio to, not long ago, 4G. The electromagnetic spectrum, in its material ambiguity, lends itself to multiple imaginaries and applications. To regulators and carriers, it’s real estate to be parceled up and sold; it’s territory to be fought for. To technoenthusiasts, it’s an ethereal realm of possibility and opportunity. To others, it’s a commons. As Greta Byrum suggested to me, public airwaves are like public lands, and we have to ask who should benefit from their use. To still others, it’s the Wild West: With cars, pacemakers, and mobile payment apps all linked through the ether, some worry (as this New Yorker article details) that the 5G world presents new opportunities to shady entrepreneurs, hackers, and cyberterrorists. And to some members of the public, electromagnetic waves are an invasive, penetrating, irradiating force, blasting us with the data of billions of connected objects. — [Updated on 2021-11-29 13:22:26](https://hyp.is/AydLZFEPEeyVO7M5B3-hhg/reallifemag.com/networked-dream-worlds/) — Group: #Public
