## Page Notes
I wanted to read this article because I love Kon's movies and I'm curious what the link to social media is.

## Highlights
- Mima‚Äôs stalker, who goes by Mimania (or Memania), creates a website called MimasRoom.com where he details his obsession by posing as Mima on the internet. ‚Äî [Updated on 2022-08-19 16:17:24](https://hyp.is/pWBcZh_JEe2X2C9BmDPMMA/reallifemag.com/dreaming-in-color/) ‚Äî Group: #Public
    - Annotation: It's fantastic that this site still exists!
- On the internet, Mima learns, illusions can become real, or at least can become indistinguishable from reality. ‚Äî [Updated on 2022-08-19 16:18:11](https://hyp.is/wcLfKB_JEe2GxtMsf4yMxQ/reallifemag.com/dreaming-in-color/) ‚Äî Group: #Public
    - Annotation: "On the internet men are men, women are also men and kids are actually cops." or so the saying went‚Ä¶
- In a move that prefigures the dizzying consequences of social media avatars and deepfakes, Mima finds that the ‚Äúreal Mima‚Äù of the internet has become realer to Mima than herself. ‚Äî [Updated on 2022-08-19 16:18:54](https://hyp.is/23fExB_JEe2a7j85ARUenA/reallifemag.com/dreaming-in-color/) ‚Äî Group: #Public
    - Annotation: A visionary telling of social media.
- The irony is that Kon, who was prying open the boundaries between these seemingly separated realms, in the end, at least in Perfect Blue, ends up reasserting a digital and psychic dualism. Yet watching Perfect Blue incited a visceral experience of augmented reality.  ‚Äî [Updated on 2022-08-19 16:20:19](https://hyp.is/DcBQLB_KEe2fsF9PzNEOHg/reallifemag.com/dreaming-in-color/) ‚Äî Group: #Public

- Kon parodies the ‚Äúboy genius‚Äù recklessness of Silicon Valley disruptors in the character of Dr. K≈çsaku Tokita, the DC Mini‚Äôs inventor, whose excessive weight and childlike obsession with toys underscore his shrugging off of moral responsibility for his invention. ‚Äî [Updated on 2022-08-19 16:21:45](https://hyp.is/QRYU1B_KEe2Wsd95N86rwA/reallifemag.com/dreaming-in-color/) ‚Äî Group: #Public
    - Annotation: That's actually a pretty accurat depiction of the boys of Silicon Valley‚Ä¶
- ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think dreams and the internet are similar?‚Äù ‚Äî [Updated on 2022-08-19 16:22:48](https://hyp.is/ZsJQRB_KEe2GyScq8ktzoA/reallifemag.com/dreaming-in-color/) ‚Äî Group: #Public

- In Paprika, the internet, like the unconscious, becomes a theater for the excess libidinal energies otherwise excised from waking life. ‚Äî [Updated on 2022-08-19 16:23:01](https://hyp.is/blP8QB_KEe2m85-lf0zOMQ/reallifemag.com/dreaming-in-color/) ‚Äî Group: #Public

- Paprika better reflects the risk of artificial intelligence ‚Äî not that the technology itself will become sentient, but that it will be manipulated by those already in power ‚Äî [Updated on 2022-08-19 16:23:36](https://hyp.is/g1bZyB_KEe2X2stR4Tkrkw/reallifemag.com/dreaming-in-color/) ‚Äî Group: #Public
