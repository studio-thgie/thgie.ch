## Highlights
- But Apple’s highly engineered knits seem controllable and aesthetically precise in a way that leather could never be. Watching the video, with its moments of gleaming technological perfection colliding with fuzzy sweaters and strands of backlit hair, it’s clear that textiles are being called on to perform some important ideological work. — [Updated on 2021-06-20 08:46:46](https://hyp.is/SA5f8tGTEeulb98r3Wfnrw/reallifemag.com/cozy-tech/) — Group: #Public

- The upswing in textiles as a component of tech devices is coincident with the growth of smart home devices as a product category. As technology makers work to ensure internet-connected objects become a ubiquitous presence in domestic spaces, it is essential that these things feel approachable and comforting. — [Updated on 2021-06-20 08:47:24](https://hyp.is/XwVo9NGTEeueVqcCpU-juA/reallifemag.com/cozy-tech/) — Group: #Public

- These and other devices gestured toward a future of cyborg connectivity and seamless integration with technology, where we might become one with our tech by implanting it, wearing it, nestling it into our ear canals and around our wrists. — [Updated on 2021-06-20 08:48:24](https://hyp.is/goa23tGTEeu9hdtnKcqIsw/reallifemag.com/cozy-tech/) — Group: #Public

- A computer is a rock that we’ve tricked into thinking; Google Home Mini is a rock we’ve been tricked into forgetting is a computer. — [Updated on 2021-06-20 08:49:58](https://hyp.is/usyIytGTEeu996PTd1WSFQ/reallifemag.com/cozy-tech/) — Group: #Public

- Google Home Mini and its cohort are that rare class of digital object: a gadget unencumbered by a preexisting form. It must have a speaker, and it must have electronic innards, but unlike a smart fridge (fridge shaped) or a smart lightbulb (lightbulb shaped), the smart home speaker is an object without qualities. How do we imagine omnipresent technology; how do we imagine computing environments without computer interfaces?  — [Updated on 2021-06-20 08:50:37](https://hyp.is/0fZgcNGTEeul6vviQyrPYg/reallifemag.com/cozy-tech/) — Group: #Public

- A similar sort of message, stripped of any righteous connotation, can be read through Apple and Google’s marketing, which gestures toward the craft and history of textile production as a way to assuage our fears about unfamiliar surveillance technology, and put a familiar and comforting spin on the “smart” future. — [Updated on 2021-06-20 08:54:12](https://hyp.is/UcG_KtGUEeu6SqtnGXz_NQ/reallifemag.com/cozy-tech/) — Group: #Public

- This transmutation — the congealing of labor into value, and the violence hidden within — is an unstable process. — [Updated on 2021-06-20 08:56:34](https://hyp.is/pmvhwtGUEeu-sqfTZNE4sQ/reallifemag.com/cozy-tech/) — Group: #Public

- Smart fabrics and the luscious textiles that cover smart home assistants are, if anything, doubly alienated. After the transition of raw material and labor to commodity, the fibers are embedded with sensors or draped over internet-connected speakers, far removed from their earlier function as a cloth that warms and protects, connected to global systems of data collection and capital. What repressed horrors might bubble and reemerge with these strange new fabrics? What animating forces might be smuggled beneath the light-dappled cloth? Perhaps it’s just cloth. But with cloth comes a long history of labor, industry, computation, commodity fetishism, and fantasy. It’s never just cloth. — [Updated on 2021-06-20 08:57:27](https://hyp.is/xn_YztGUEeu5dgNu0SihfQ/reallifemag.com/cozy-tech/) — Group: #Public
