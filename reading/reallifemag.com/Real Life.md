## Highlights
- At the heart of this ambition is something that we might call “synaesthetic fallacy”: the technological promise that all data is translatable into other data, and that these processes of translation are impartial and organic. — [Updated on 2021-06-03 08:19:53](https://hyp.is/tgJzMMQzEeuwHE9qmzEBjw/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public

- She pointed out that much of our understanding of communicative diversity and technological mediation between different senses and lexicons comes from differently abled thinkers and inventors: for example, textual descriptions of images, text-to-speech software, and EEG technology that converts brainwaves to speech. Within critical disability theory, these technologically mediated processes are never positioned as impartial; they are always treated as relational and value-laden, unfolding at the intersection of many different ways of knowing. — [Updated on 2021-06-03 08:20:29](https://hyp.is/y0CFrMQzEeunInuy9SnWIw/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public

- By contrast, the contemporary use of synaesthesia as a metaphor in interaction design implies  the existence of an objective set of sensory correlations that can be brought out by technology alone. The idea that we need gadgets to “translate” the world around us is used to justify the omnipresence of gadgetry in every facet of life, lending both scientific legitimation and an aura magic to the idea of the interactive or animate city. — [Updated on 2021-06-03 08:20:41](https://hyp.is/0h7CHMQzEeuvXlfON7hIqA/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public

- Such projects cloak themselves in the language of synergy: an intimacy between the built environment and the people living in it that is so profound it becomes a sort of shared consciousness. In reality, though, it is a convenient way for private interests to seize greater control over the city space through digital overlay.  — [Updated on 2021-06-03 08:20:54](https://hyp.is/2eZg6sQzEeuUHnNYpymjIA/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public

- There is a latent violence to this action of hand to throat (“touch gently,” the video warns); but unlike in Paik and Moorman’s work, which embraces the easy slippage between violence and tenderness, instrumentalization and intimacy, the Playtronica video deliberately neutralizes this charge, opting for a minimalist, block-color, sans-serif neatness. — [Updated on 2021-06-03 09:56:30](https://hyp.is/NNr4-sRBEeusCS_9mK5Kxw/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public

- Technological ubiquity under neoliberalism largely flattens the natural complexities of communication, narrowing down ways to interact and to know — [Updated on 2021-06-03 09:58:03](https://hyp.is/3QKUEMQzEeuWandAe9lSjw/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: This is such a beautiful and relevant bit, as long as it exists within the context of this article. I can relate a lot :)
- The success of technologies like Playtronica points to a real desire for communication between human and non-human worlds, something that we seem more ready to believe in when it involves technological mediation. — [Updated on 2021-06-04 08:12:39](https://hyp.is/0vXPWsT7Eeu5eD-b-qwlkw/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Where is this comming from?
- The more our interactions with the world are mediated by technologies that gloss over the frictions and ambiguities by which we acquire meaning for each other, the more we drift towards commodification, because it is through ambiguity that we resist quantifiability. — [Updated on 2021-06-04 08:17:24](https://hyp.is/fDXDQMT8EeucI3vpsTopOQ/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public

- But the ambition of perfect communication between entities is a trap. The interaction of machines and human bodies can be exciting terrain precisely because it is fraught with complex processes of negotiation. Ambiguity and complexity is engagement: when we fail to recognize this, and instead prioritize the generalized efficiency of conversions between different sorts of data, we edge towards the commodification of all our interactions. — [Updated on 2021-06-04 08:17:45](https://hyp.is/ui1tUsQzEeuIMSttmNvYmg/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public

- On his blog, theorist Steven Shaviro takes up Marx’ notion of commodity fetishism, writing that “commodities actually are alive: more alive, perhaps, than we ourselves are. They ‘appear,’ or stand forth, or ‘shine’ (the word Marx uses is scheinen) as autonomous beings” — they seem to possess the ability to act and feel independently of us. Animating the world via technological appendages doesn’t increase our engagement with it; instead, it bolsters processes of commodification, because, according to Shaviro, the commodities possess more agency than we ourselves do. Emphasizing interactivity for interactivity’s sake renders the world meaningless until it is activated by technology — then technology (and capital) becomes the dominant life force. — [Updated on 2021-06-04 08:20:21](https://hyp.is/8PNI2MT8EeuQGNdHocxG-w/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Fetish, and by extension animism, Marx and IoT brought together.
- Our relationship with technology, though, is a chaotic one; in fact all interaction is by definition chaotic. Any form of play that does not center this chaos — which instead envisages human-machine interaction as a seamless unbroken circuit — will always subordinate the human to the level of object, rather than elevating an object to the level of the human. In attempting to make the world more animate, we risk de-animating ourselves. — [Updated on 2021-06-04 08:29:15](https://hyp.is/LtYAIsT-EeucJ7v37fyEeg/reallifemag.com/the-sounds-of-silence/) — Group: #Public
