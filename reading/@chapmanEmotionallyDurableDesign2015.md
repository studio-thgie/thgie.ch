> "Waste is a failed relationship"

#reading-notes 

- Sustainability design lacks philosophical depth
- Product design focuses to much on tech and functionality and wastes potential
- Products are not able to evolve with their owners or sustain empathy
- Material consumption is the active creation of self
- Awareness of the ecological crisis paralizes the individual
- Consumption is desire/need driven
- Consumption is actually meaning, not matter. Matter only holds the meaning
- Consumers undig layers of meaning until there is no more
----
- Obsolescenes is also a consumer problem, since the product cant evolve with owner
- deflowering (sexist term): getting to know, familiarising, outgrow - Sartre
- modern products are to smart -> no mistery
- we search for thigns that support our own perception
- -> animism as a psychological support frameworks to embed meaning in the environment
- ego is expressed through objects, not words
- empathy has a lifespan, waste is a lack of empathy
- sustainable/durable materials add actually to the pile of waste

#thoughts

- the difference between physical and epitemological animation/animatedness
