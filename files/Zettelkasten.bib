  abstract = {Prototypes are objects that approximate the features of a product or service. In design practice, prototypes are known as objects that can facilitate collaboration across heterogeneous groups, thereby instantiating changes that can foster innovation. Powerful as this function may be, the focus on prototypes' boundary properties has obscured their own endemic dynamism as objects, making it difficult to capture the ongoing dynamic of prototypes within the practices that they mediate. We use the notion of epistemic objects to capture how prototypes highlight what is absent, raise questions, and unfold indefinitely over time. Drawing on participant observation and interview data from a 6-week university invention accelerator, we show that prototypes mediate collaboration practices as well as unfold dynamically over time. Our conceptualization of prototypes as epistemic objects captures both the nature and function of artifacts as they facilitate dynamic practices.},

  note = {``In design practice, prototypes are objects that approximate the features of a product or service [3]. They are known for their boundary-mediating capacity to facilitate conversations among heterogeneous groups with shared interests [17, 18]. Through such conversations, prototypes can facilitate learning among groups by foregrounding new issues [12, 16, 24]. Indeed, Gill et al. [9] describe prototypes as ``design thinking enablers'' for their ability to help designers generate and refine their designs. As a means of exploring new design ideas, prototypes are objects that constitute innovation and collaboration practices among heterogeneous groups of people [24].'' (Asante-Agyei et al., 2022, p. 1)
\par
Fantastic summary of prototypes as boundary objects.
\par
They mention that prototypes are highly dynamic. So making snapshots, through documentation and the like, is a way to make them more sustainable.
\par
``Because they are incomplete, epistemic objects do not have fixed qualities as a boundary object might; rather, they point to what is absent. In other words, they are defined ``by what they are not (but will, at some point have become) than by what they are'' [14, p.200]. By pointing to what is absent, they help detail what is not yet known. This way, they can be a source of constant change and innovation [15, 20]. By raising questions, epistemic objects have the ability to unfold indefinitely'' (Asante-Agyei et al., 2022, p. 2)

We argue that cell phone repair shops provide a distinctive site in which to unpack various articulations of the commodity fetishism of cell phones, the craft of repair, and thus the distinctive materiality of these now essential technological devices. By focusing on the tools and the techniques for their use, this ethnographic account highlights the ways in which repair, as an embodied practice, variously reveals, conceals, and constructs the value and agency of cell phones in the context of an emerging post-Fordist economy.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe a co-design methodology aiming to incorporate, synthesise and co-create different kinds of knowledge in the design process. Artifacts are creations of body/mind/thing assemblages (Latour, 2007); their physical structure prescribes technical functions existing within a context of human action (Kroes, 2012). The material, the social and the practical exist within a threefold design semiosis (Zingale \& Domingues, 2015). The artifact, a ``semiotic organism'', acts as the transmitter of values and as a catalyst in shaping cultural systems. The mediation of each of the facets of the artifact produces different types of knowledge, namely tacit, empirical and scientific knowledge while shaping and being shaped through said mediation.},

By realizing the agency of non-humans, we are able to see them not as simple intermediaries within networks of humans, but as mediators in the collective uncertainty management'' (Bofylatos and Spyrou, 2017, p. 4423)
\par
This part is relevant when proposing participation as a strategy of sustainability, through furthering accessibility of a prototypical artifact.
\par
Seeing prototypes (prototypical artifacts) as assemblages is an interesting twist.
\par
``Thus, the meaning of an artifact can be neither solely embodied by the artifact itself nor inside the assemblage to which it belongs, but it rather lies in all the possible practical or mental actions that the artifact is able to involve.'' (Bofylatos and Spyrou, 2017, p. 4424)

Can this be adapted to knowledge? The knowledge bound to an artifact can neither be solely within nor without but resides in the relations we are able to spin up?obs
\par
``The artifact \textendash{} or more generally, every artificial reality in which we live \textendash{} is thus to be conceived as a place where a ``common mind'' is shaped: a place of shared behavioural and cognitive habits, beliefs and opinions, compared and contrasted viewpoints or values, the place where shared meaning resides.''

This article explores how we might progress with a methodology born in an age of early globalisation, when tracing things was easier and more surprising than today. It suggests that attempting to understand the unfollowable bits of the commodity trail may be an apposite way to go about such studies, especially in the light of the fact that globalisation is now a well-established phenomenon and capitalism's precarious nature shows no sign of abating.},

\par
Until 1990 (and onwards until this paper) relatively little effort was made to understand the users and usage of archives and archival methods. It was assumed that it was archivists and historians that know their way around.
\par
The actual user base has changed in the last thirty years:
\par
``a significant portion of visitors are at the moment people looking for information instead of data'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 17)
\par
The differentiation between information and data is relevant. Archivist and historians are gather information from data themselves, whereas others often don't have the necessary skills, knowledge or processes at hand to do so.
\par
The change in user base is linked to the growth of records, but also new services and of course, digitization. Further, the public's stance towards archives has changed.
\par
``Following the argument of Ketelaar (1992), archives and information are more of the people, by the people, and for the people than the people are for the archives.'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 18)
\par
In a post-modern view, the neutrality of an archive isn't given anymore. There is a pluriverse of viewpoints at hands.
\par
\subsection{Digital archives at Saari Manor and Kajaani Castle}

\subsubsection{Methods and strategy}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
unstructured expert interviews

\item 
requirement engineering, validated with experts and potential user group (n=15)

\item 
qualitative document analysis (Altheide)

\item 
development of indexing and classification

\end{itemize}

\par
``The central themes which appeared in the discussions were geographical dispersion of individual users, existence of multiple parallel viewpoints, interpretations of each information object, variety of the types of relevant information objects (ranging from manuscripts to physical objects and measurement data), and the fact that expertise in different aspects of the information objects was held by different individuals.'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 20)
\par
This snippet feels so relevant\ldots{}
\par
\subsubsection{Findings, Requirements}

\par
The following requirements were extracted from the ``principal findings'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 20).
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Multiuser browsing, editing, and maintenance

\item 
Versions and tracking of changes on the level of individual contributors

\item 
Flexibility of data and structure

\item 
Flexibility of description

\item 
Searchability and formalisation of decriptions

\item 
Standard file formats

\item 
Standard, inexpensive, and easily transferable software

\end{itemize}

\par
From an infrastructural view, the balance between flexibility part is extremely interesting. It seems to be about including unknown future cases. In the end they chose a the semantic mediawiki as base for their platform :)
\par
\subsection{Envisioning a participatory archive}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
self-steering, as in crowd

\item 
emphasis on collaborativeness and conversationality of archive building

\item 
easy entry and total findability

\item 
supervision has only maintenance function, not value judgment or facilitation

\end{itemize}

\par
``Unlike in the access paradigm of Menne-Haritz (2001), a participatory archive pursues transparency through participation and not its opposite. Inclusion and greater participation are supposed to reveal a diversity of motivations, viewpoints, arguments and counterarguments, which become transparent when a critical mass is attained.'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 25)
\par
Further, a participatory archive is characterized by
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item 
Decentralized curation

\item 
Radical user orientation

\item 
Contextualization of both records and the entire archival process

\end{enumerate}

\par
Infrastructural participation:
\par
``In a participatory archive, the usability does not denote use alone, but also denotes a deeper level of involvement in the sense of actual participation in the archive and in the archival process.'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 25)
\par
A similar project incorporates participatory approaches through functions like ``commenting, collaborative filtering, bookmarking, and visitor awareness'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 25). User awareness is implemented differently in the present study and regarded through ``following changes and contributions rather than browsing and the movement throughout a site'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 26). There is importance in what user engagement is tracked and categorized as participatory. See also Nick Seaver on user tracking (Seaver, 2021).
\par
There is a lot to unpack in the described differences between the ``participatory archiving model'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 26) by Shilton and Srinivasan and the proposed participatory archive. I'll include the text directly.
\par
``The first difference in the approaches is that Shilton and Srinivasan seem to discuss essentially building, appraisal, provenance, ordering and description of an archival collection, and participatory development of archival ontologies instead of working with an archive as an evolving corpus of process-bound information with self-emerging ontologies. The second major difference is that in the participatory archiving model, communities are an actor, and the archive will be based on a consensual community ontology of the participating community members set within a theoretical framework based on archival science. In a participatory archive, there is no predetermined consensual community. The `community' is a sum of all individual structures, descriptions, orders, and viewpoints contributed by individual participating archive users whether they are users or contributors, archivists, researchers, administrators, labourers, or belong to marginalised communities or the majority. The proposed role for information managers is to maintain the technical platform, to provide adequate tools for working with the archive and to provide a minimum technical level of findability of individual records. Otherwise than from the technical point of view, information managers are equal to the other users of the archive. Their role is not to direct the process of how an archive emerges, how something is described or appraised or what provenances relate to the materials.'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 26)
\par
It essentially boils down to who has the authority to manage the archives content \textendash{} the archivists or the community.
\par
``postcontrolled'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 26) 😍
\par
Seen from this vantage point, enabling users to simply contact the archive through mail or contact forms (as seen with many participatory archive projects) is simply not enough. The discussion and authority of publicity still lies within the archive and the public is excluded.
\par
The role of the archivist in a participatory archive shifts and is still crucial. See ``responsibilities'' (Huvila, 2008, p. 27).
\par
\subsection{Discussion and conclusion}

\par
Yes\ldots{} that's the gist of it
\par
``The most essential question regarding a participatory archive is whether it works or not: whether the users contribute to an archive and whether the contributions create added value. According to the earlier studies on collaborative digital information repositories, the functional sustainability of a repository is highly dependent on the activity of archive users and the emergence of a culture of collaboration, integration into daily practises, and a critical mass to sustain necessary level of contributions, which obliges others to contribute (Peddibhotla and Subramani 2007; Hollingshead et al. 2002; Dings\o yr and R\o yrvik 2003).''
