  abstract = {In time, phenomenology has become a viable approach to conducting qualitative studies in education. Popular and well-established methods include descriptive and hermeneutic phenomenology. Based on critiques of the essentialism and receptivity of these two methods, however, this article offers a third variation of empirical phenomenology: Postphenomenology. The article introduces postphenomenology, a philosophy of technology that highlights the importance of technological mediation of experience: Technologies transform our perceptions (amplify/reduce) and translate our actions (invite/inhibit). Based on this framework, two approaches to empirical fieldwork are suggested: In-depth exploration of the typical use of a given technology and critical comparison of multiple versions of a technology. It is argued that using postphenomenology as a research method helps researchers explore technological mediation, a vital and oft-neglected aspect of educational practice, but the method simultaneously entails epistemological commitments such as multistability, reflexivity, and posthumanism. The article concludes by discussing future challenges for the postphenomenological method.},

\par
For a profession in which the purpose is allegedly transformative problem-solving, and which features an array of manifestos on what we can do to change the world; design solutions are incredibly conservative. We continue to populate the world with junk and have become complicit in designing people into a culture of convenience. Convenience is the most underestimated and least understood force in the world today. All around the world, convenience—more efficient and easier ways of doing personal tasks—has emerged as perhaps the most powerful driver shaping our individual lives and our economies. Convenience seems to make our decisions for us, trumping what we like to imagine are our true preferences. Easy is better; easiest is best. While convenience has its benefits, it also has a dark side. It makes us lazy—spoiled by immediacy. This is a fact we are witnessing right now amidst the pandemic.

Wobbrock DIS '20: The ACM conference on Designing Interactive Systems Session: Session: Folding, printing and exploring tangible interactions Abstract Gesture elicitation studies represent a popular and resourceful method in HCI to inform the design of intuitive gesture commands, reflective of end-users’ behavior, for controlling all kinds of interactive devices, applications, and systems. In the last ten years, an impressive body of work has been published on this topic, disseminating useful design knowledge regarding users’ preferences for finger, hand, wrist, arm, head, leg, foot, and whole-body gestures. In this paper, we deliver a systematic literature review of this large body of work by summarizing the characteristics and findings ofN=216gesture elicitation studies subsuming 5,458 participants,  3,625 referents,  and 148,340 elicited gestures. We highlight the descriptive, comparative, and generative virtues of our examination to provide practitioners with an effective method to (i) understand how new gesture elicitation studies position in the literature; (ii) compare studies from different authors; and (iii) identify opportunities for new research.

The capacity to act does not at first imply a specific moral dimension to the ability to make the choice to act, and moral agency is therefore a distinct concept. In sociology, an agent is an individual engaging with the social structure. Notably, though, the primacy of social structure vs. individual capacity with regard to persons' actions is debated within sociology. This debate concerns, at least partly, the level of reflexivity an agent may possess.Agency may either be classified as unconscious, involuntary behavior, or purposeful, goal directed activity (intentional action). An agent typically has some sort of immediate awareness of their physical activity and the goals that the activity is aimed at realizing. In ‘goal directed action’ an agent implements a kind of direct control or guidance over their own behavior.},

Literature from the disciplines of artificial intelligence (hereinafter AI), product design (industrial engineering), human factors (ergonomics), social psychology, communication and sociology (sociological experiments) have been incorporated in this study to understand the psychology of human thought and cognition, everyday things and designer’s ability of utilizing these psychologies and of users for addressing, first, the role that a smart home can play as a leisure equipment/device/object, and secondly, granting its user the control and ease of operability they desire.},

  abstract = {We have no interest whatever in minimizing the continuing history of racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive biologisms, or the urgency of their exposure, that has made the gravamen of so many contemporary projects of critique. At the same time, we fear — with installation of an automatic antibiologism as the unshifting tenet of `theory' — the loss of conceptual access to an entire thought-realm. (Sedgwick and Frank, 1995: 15), I was left wondering what danger had been averted by the exclusion of biology. What does the nominative `biological or anatomical body' actually refer to? And what secures the separation of its inadmissible matter from the proper purview of Irigaray's textual interventions? When I asked a question to this effect it was met with a certain nervous comprehension. Deciding, perhaps, that I must still be immersed in a precritical understanding of the body, the speaker dismissed me with a revealing theatrical gesture. As if to emphasize the sheer absurdity of my question she pinched herself and commented `Well I don't mean this body'. And so it seemed with a gesture so matter of fact that it required no further comment, the fact of (the) matter was both decided and dispatched. (Kirby, 1997: 70), Feminism has been as deeply implicated in routinized antiessentialism as any of our critical procedures. Even though questions of `the body' have become increasingly fashionable in all manner of feminist projects (surely `the body' has become, in a very short space of time, one of our most routinized theoretical gestures), the schedule of feminism's antibiologism has been little altered. In most of these projects on `the body', the body in question is pursued in its socially, experientially, or psychically constituted forms, but rarely in its physiologically, biochemically, or microbiologically constituted form, the idea of biological construction having been rendered either unintelligible or naive. Despite an avowed interest in the body, there is a persistent distaste for biological detail. (Wilson, 1998: 14—15), These feminist theories have usually been reluctant to engage with biological data: they retain, and encourage, the fierce antibiologism that marked the emergence of second wave feminism. (Wilson, 2004: 13), That feminist scholars are particularly prone to a `knee jerk constructivism' helps explain the reluctance of those in the humanities to engage seriously with the claims of science. (Squier, 2004: 46), This book functions primarily as a reminder to social, political, and cultural theorists, particularly those interested in feminism, antiracism and questions of the politics of globalisation, that they have forgotten a crucial dimension of research, if not necessary to, then certainly useful for more incisively formulating the concepts on which they so heavily, if implicitly rely. It is written as a remembrance of what we have forgotten — not just the body, but that which makes it possible and which limits its actions: the precarious, accidental, contingent, expedient, striving, dynamic status of life in a messy, complicated, resistant, brute world of materiality, a world regulated by the exigencies, the forces, of space and time. We have forgotten the nature, the ontology, of the body, the conditions under which bodies are encultured, psychologized, given identity, historical location, and agency. We have forgotten where we come from. (Grosz, 2004a: 2)},

Focal areas in this literature review will be to find out: (1) which theories and frameworks of product semantics are specifically relevant for creating meaning and value in design? (2) How formal aesthetics and gestalt principles connect and influence the different product semantic frameworks. Results have indicated that in the semantic frameworks discussed in this article, formal aesthetic and gestalt theories have been established at the cognitive level. They indirectly incorporate formal aesthetic principles, such as geometry, dimension, texture, material, color, graphics and detailing. These principles were addressed from an analytical and descriptive perspective to create a more in-depth cognitive understanding of products and product forms. Although, none of the frameworks proposed the development of a formal design tool for using formal aesthetic characteristics in the generation of prospective formdominant products, Karjalainen and Snelder´s semantic transformation framework, could be further developed to incorporate gestalt and formal aesthetics, through the key drivers.},

In~Alive in the Writing—an intriguing hybrid of writing guide, biography, and literary analysis—anthropologist and novelist Kirin Narayan introduces readers to some other sides of Chekhov: his pithy, witty observations on the writing process, his life as a writer through accounts by his friends, family, and lovers, and his venture into nonfiction through his book~Sakhalin Island. By closely attending to the people who lived under the appalling conditions of the Russian penal colony on Sakhalin, Chekhov showed how empirical details combined with a literary flair can bring readers face to face with distant, different lives, enlarging a sense of human responsibility. Highlighting this balance of the empirical and the literary, Narayan calls on Chekhov to bring new energy to the writing of ethnography and creative nonfiction alike. Weaving together selections from writing by and about him with examples from other talented ethnographers and memoirists, she offers practical exercises and advice on topics such as story, theory, place, person, voice, and self. A new and lively exploration of ethnography,~Alive in the Writing~shows how the genre’s attentive, sustained connection with the lives of others can become a powerful tool for any writer.}

  abstract = {Prototypes are objects that approximate the features of a product or service. In design practice, prototypes are known as objects that can facilitate collaboration across heterogeneous groups, thereby instantiating changes that can foster innovation. Powerful as this function may be, the focus on prototypes’ boundary properties has obscured their own endemic dynamism as objects, making it difficult to capture the ongoing dynamic of prototypes within the practices that they mediate. We use the notion of epistemic objects to capture how prototypes highlight what is absent, raise questions, and unfold indefinitely over time. Drawing on participant observation and interview data from a 6-week university invention accelerator, we show that prototypes mediate collaboration practices as well as unfold dynamically over time. Our conceptualization of prototypes as epistemic objects captures both the nature and function of artifacts as they facilitate dynamic practices.},

  note = {“In design practice, prototypes are objects that approximate the features of a product or service [3]. They are known for their boundary-mediating capacity to facilitate conversations among heterogeneous groups with shared interests [17, 18]. Through such conversations, prototypes can facilitate learning among groups by foregrounding new issues [12, 16, 24]. Indeed, Gill et al. [9] describe prototypes as “design thinking enablers” for their ability to help designers generate and refine their designs. As a means of exploring new design ideas, prototypes are objects that constitute innovation and collaboration practices among heterogeneous groups of people [24].” (Asante-Agyei et al., 2022, p. 1)
\par
Fantastic summary of prototypes as boundary objects.
\par
They mention that prototypes are highly dynamic. So making snapshots, through documentation and the like, is a way to make them more sustainable.
\par
“Because they are incomplete, epistemic objects do not have fixed qualities as a boundary object might; rather, they point to what is absent. In other words, they are defined “by what they are not (but will, at some point have become) than by what they are” [14, p.200]. By pointing to what is absent, they help detail what is not yet known. This way, they can be a source of constant change and innovation [15, 20]. By raising questions, epistemic objects have the ability to unfold indefinitely” (Asante-Agyei et al., 2022, p. 2)

Diese spannt sich für ihn nicht wie für andere Humanisten durch die Tradition klassischer Texte auf, sondern über \textbf{Objekte}, \textbf{Relikte} und andere \textbf{materielle Spuren} der Vergangenheit. Anders als andere Humanisten blickt er nicht auf Texte, sondern auf \textbf{Überreste}, nicht auf Botschaften, sondern auf \textbf{Spuren} vergangen er Epochen.}" (p. 166)

\item \emph{Die Zeit ist für Browne \textbf{keine neutrale Dimension}; sie hat selbst eine Gestalt, die sich wie die Götter in paganen Mysterien schrittweise offenbart.} (p. 167)

\item \emph{Diesen Gedanken konnte Browne von Seneca übernehmen, der die Entdeckung des Neuen als einen Prozess fortschreitender Selbst-Offenbarung der Natur beschrieben hat. (p. 167)}\emph{}

\item \emph{Brownes antiquarische Archäologie führt uns an eine ganz andere Vergangenheit heran, sozusagen an eine Vergangenheit hoch zwei, die nicht nur vergangen, sondern auch tief vergessen ist, v\textbf{on der keine Kunde mehr auf Erden existiert,} \textbf{und die das kulturelle Gedächtnis nicht mehr zurückholen kann}. (p. 168)}\emph{}

\item \emph{Nicht Erinnern, sondern \textbf{Vergessen} ist deshalb der beste Konservator: "\textbf{Unischtbarkeit} war das Mittel ihrer Dauer und Entzogenheit ihr Schutz." (p. 168)}

  abstract = {Personhood and relationality have re-animated debate in and between many disciplines. We are in the midst of a simultaneous "ontological turn", a "(re)turn to things" and a "relational turn", and also debating a "new animism". It is increasingly recognised that the boundaries between the "natural" and "social" sciences are of heuristic value but might not adequately describe reality of a multi-species world. Following rich and provocative dialogues between ethnologists and Indigenous experts, relations between the received knowledge of Western Modernity and that of people who dwell and move within different ontologies have shifted. Reflection on human relations with the larger-than-human world can no longer rely on the outdated assumption that "nature" and "cultures" already accurately describe the lineaments of reality. The chapters in this volume advance debates about relations between humans and things, between scholars and others, and between Modern and Indigenous ontologies. They consider how terms in diverse communities might hinder or help express, evidence and explore improved ways of knowing and being in the world. Contributors to this volume bring different perspectives and approaches to bear on questions about animism, personhood, materiality, and relationality. They include anthropologists, archaeologists, ethnographers, and scholars of religion.},

This study is aimed at exploring the usability evaluation process of an assistive technology on the example of Face Controller (FC). To trace the evaluation process, a comparison of the FC usability evaluation between PWDs (N = 29) and persons with no disabilities (PNDs; N = 32) was performed. The present study revealed that the PWDs reported higher satisfaction and perceived usability of the FC comparing to the PNDs, whereas the effectiveness and efficiency were both lower for PWDs. This asymmetrical pattern of the results in the evaluation of the FC usability is discussed as an extension of disability paradox and can enhance the understanding of conceptualization and evaluation HCI made by PWDs.},

Both - Are broadly applicable across subject matters - concern the particular and the probable - require invention and judgment, and - involve arrangement in space and time From ancient times through the Renaissance, rhetoric was a key element in education, and its methods were widely adapted to other arts, including design. Rhetoric's loss of status in modern times is explained, and its resurgence in the latter part of the 20th century is described through the works of three scholars that focus on the relationship between rhetoric and design. The conceptualization of these scholars is best represented in the view that rhetoric is design limited to words and design is rhetoric with an unlimited palette.},

This paper addresses the different ways that platforms are coming into focus, evidenced by growing literatures on platform capitalism, the platform society, platform surveillance, and platform urbanism. Navigating this platform pivot, I discuss the way platform influence is predominantly linked to processes of data-driven commodification and value extraction, as demonstrated by the global growth of major platforms such as Google, Facebook, Uber, and Amazon. But at the level of the everyday, platform influence also shapes socio-spatial experience through intentional design tactics designed to facilitate highly participatory ecosystems of interaction. I argue that by instituting relational dynamics between code, commerce, and corporeality, platforms remediate the “technological everyday” in powerful ways. This perspective points to the need for diverse epistemologies through which to critically reflect on the geographical implications of this pivot towards platforms.},

We draw upon a study of communities in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, where a well-established cultural heritage tradition has developed and is continuing to do so with the adoption of various digital technologies. The paper argues that cultural heritage offers a real sense of cultural value for participants and communities for which digitisation offers both threats and opportunities.

Since that time a great deal of academic and business attention to the topic of anthropomorphism has resulted in the related work on brand mascots, brand personality, marketplace mythologies, and anthropomorphism in product design and advertising. In addition, new arenas of anthropomorphism have emerged with developments in projective research methods, digital avatars, robot design, digital self-presentation, and conversational digital assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. Such novel directions have prompted new research questions and further studies. This paper offers a brief update of the evolving issues in the co-creation of anthropomorphic objects and brand interpretations by consumers, designers, roboticists, engineers, and marketers.},

Within the UbiComp literature we see intimacy portrayed as: knowledge our appliances and applications have about us and the minutiae of our day-to-day lives; physical closeness, incarnated on the body as wearable computing and in the body as ‘nanobots’; and computer mediated connection with friends, lovers, confidantes and colleagues. As appliances and computation move away from the desktop, and as designers move toward designing for emotion and social connection rather than usability and utility, we are poised to design technologies that are explicitly intimate and/or intimacy promoting. This workshop will: critically reflect on notions of intimacy; consider cultural and ethical issues in designing intimate technologies; and explore potential socio-technical design methods for intimate computing.},

  abstract = {The theory of technological mediation aims to take technological artifacts seriously, recognizing the constitutive role they play in how we experience the world, act in it, and how we are constituted as (moral) subjects. Its quest for a compatible ethics has led it to Foucault’s “care of the self,” i.e., a transformation of the self by oneself through self-discipline. In this regard, technologies have been interpreted as power structures to which one can relate through Foucaultian “technologies of the self” or ascetic practices. However, this leaves unexplored how concrete technologies can actually support the process of self-care. This paper explores this possibility by examining one such technology: a gamified ToDo list app. Doing so, it first shows that despite the apparent straightforwardness of gamification, confrontation and shame play an important role in how the app motivates me to do better. Second, inspired by Ihde’s schema of humantechnology relations, it presents different ways in which the app may confront me with myself. Subsequently, it accounts for the motivation and shame that this technologically mediated confrontation with myself invokes through a Levinasian account of ethical subjectivity. In so doing, it also shows how Levinas’ phenomenology implies a responsibility for self-care and how nonhuman, technological others may still call me to responsibility. It concludes with a reflection on the role of gamification in technologically mediated subjectivation and some implications for design.},

The problem with these approaches to socially responsible design is that they are usually based on a given set of design methods. Such methods respond to conditions of practice that are outmoded and don’t respond to the contemporary presence of the image, and it’s affect on materiality and the body in design practice. This is a problem in relation to evolving ecologies where new methods are needed to tackle problems that arise because of the change. In response, this work tries to develop alternative design methods for social change, particularly by exploring the relationships between image and vital material as a key variable. Through a series of experiments the work argues for the potential of material as foundational for creating changing within a system. This proposes engagement with material, body, space \& image as a precursor to the linear and formalistic version of the design process.},

This is not only a shift from work-oriented productive activities to leisure and pleasurable engagements, but also a new milieu for production and ‘innovation’. What ‘democratic innovation’ entails is often currently defined by management and innovation research, which claims that innovation has been democratised through easy access to production tools and lead-users as the new experts driving innovation. We sketch an alternative ‘innovation’ practice more in line with the original visions of PD based on our experience of running Malmö Living Labs – an open innovation milieu where new constellations, issues and ideas evolve from bottom–up long-term collaborations among diverse stakeholders. Three cases and controversial matters of concern are discussed. The fruitfulness of the concepts ‘agonistic public spaces’ (as opposed to consensual decision-making), ‘thinging’ and ‘infrastructuring’ (as opposed to projects) are explored in relation to democracy, innovation and other future-making practices.},

Artifacts are creations of body/mind/thing assemblages (Latour, 2007); their physical structure prescribes technical functions existing within a context of human action (Kroes, 2012). The material, the social and the practical exist within a threefold design semiosis (Zingale \& Domingues, 2015). The artifact, a “semiotic organism”, acts as the transmitter of values and as a catalyst in shaping cultural systems. The mediation of each of the facets of the artifact produces different types of knowledge, namely tacit, empirical and scientific knowledge while shaping and being shaped through said mediation.},

This part is relevant when proposing participation as a strategy of sustainability, through furthering accessibility of a prototypical artifact.

Seeing prototypes (prototypical artifacts) as assemblages is an interesting twist.

“Thus, the meaning of an artifact can be neither solely embodied by the artifact itself nor inside the assemblage to which it belongs, but it rather lies in all the possible practical or mental actions that the artifact is able to involve.” (Bofylatos and Spyrou, 2017, p. 4424)

First, we start from certain definitions of design that have emancipated themselves from industrial design and that betoken a desire to improve the habitability of the world. We also highlight the connections between design and certain managerial approaches to innovation. Thus we come to question the notions of project, construction / innovation, production of possibles, temporal and spatial inscription of design, desirability, improvement of habitability or recovery from the world. We then contrast two ways of looking at design, upstream and downstream of the worlds, whether design is taken as a projection or as a correction. However, abandoning the paradigm of crisis and reincorporating design at the heart of the new climatic regime that now prevails leads to radically question this double claim. This leads us to frame the challenge in cosmological terms in order to better "de-project" design and thus to replace the human world (which is precisely not a world but an acosmia) with other relationships of consistency between beings.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to bring to design dialogue an expanded meaning of the term “commodity” by revealing its presence and discussion in other disciplines. Particularly germane to design are the notions of commodity fetishism and commodity aesthetics outlined by Karl Marx and Wolfgang Haug. Experiments in generating innovative forms largely perceived as imperative creative exercises in design are, according to Marxist thought, merely attempts to valorize capital. The redesign of product forms is labeled by Marxists as ‘aesthetic aging,’ and referred to as an activity with the sole purpose of forcefully outdating existing products. Also critical is the notion discussed by Marx, and later by Walter Benjamin, that human (and maybe robotic) labor-power expended in the making of the commodity is invisible to the consumer, thereby degrading as a value. By referring to a commodity as a product (a visible, tangible termination of the process of design and manufacture), designers align themselves at the other extreme of this idea. Modernist thinking emphasized the visibility of function and means of manufacturing of products, revealing an interesting antithesis. Theodor Adorno likens the production of culture to that of mass-produced objects. He therefore portrays the commodity as a metaphor for culture by equating its means of generation, which relies on standardized industry, to that of cultural production. Not habituated to fundamental discussions of capitalism and political economy, the debate of design history can gain from the inclusion of such material, as it will challenge existing definitions of objects, encouraging designers to engage in a broader dialogue.},

  abstract = {Digital archives are the preferred means for open access to research data. They play essential roles in knowledge infrastructures - robust networks of people, artifacts, and institutions - but little is known about how they mediate information exchange between stakeholders. We open the "black box" of data archives by studying DANS, the Data Archiving and Networked Services institute of The Netherlands, which manages 50+ years of data from the social sciences, humanities, and other domains. Our interviews, weblogs, ethnography, and document analyses reveal that a few large contributors provide a steady flow of content, but most are academic researchers who submit datasets infrequently and often restrict access to their files. Consumers are a diverse group that overlaps minimally with contributors. Archivists devote about half their time to aiding contributors with curation processes and half to assisting consumers. Given the diversity and infrequency of usage, human assistance in curation and search remains essential. DANS' knowledge infrastructure encompasses public and private stakeholders who contribute, consume, harvest, and serve their data - many of whom did not exist at the time the DANS collections originated - reinforcing the need for continuous investment in digital data archives as their communities, technologies, and services evolve.},

Indeed, small market AT may be a perfect fit for the growing field of “small batch” manufacturing in combination with motivated individuals suddenly empowered by a host of new technologies.

  abstract = {The Posthuman' starts by exploring the extent to which a post-humanist move displaces the traditional humanistic unity of the subject. Rather than perceiving this situation as a loss of cognitive and moral self-mastery, Braidotti argues that the posthuman helps us make sense of our flexible and multiple identities. Braidotti then analyzes the escalating effects of post-anthropocentric thought, which encompass not only other species, but also the sustainability of our planet as a whole. Because contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all that lives, they result in hybridization, erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species, seeds, plants, animals and bacteria. These dislocations induced by globalized cultures and economies enable a critique of anthropocentrism, but how reliable are they as indicators of a sustainable future? 'The Posthuman' concludes by considering the implications of these shifts for the institutional practice of the humanities.},

Participants included community-based archivists, advocates for community archives, academic researchers, and students. This white paper reports on key themes that emerged from this two-day workshop, and presents collaboratively-derived principles and protocols for building ethical, more equitable partnerships between academic researchers and community-based archivists in the future. Our findings surface several damaging tendencies in academic research, including: parachuting in, knowledge extraction, financial inequity, and transactional consent. We then identify nine key principles for building mutually beneficial relationships between academic researchers and community archivists: relational consent; mutual benefit; investment; humility; accountability; transparency; equity; reparation; and amplification. We then propose ways academic researchers can enact these principles via protocols for building more equitable research partnerships moving forward.},

\par
\emph{Building More Equitable Relationships Between Archival Studies Scholars and Community Archives}
\par
Current discourse highlights how academic research is not done with reciprocity in mind. Academics have more structural power then the marginalized and minorities whom they often research. This paper addresses the dos and donts in studying community archives.
\par
Community archives are often reactions of marginalized and suppressed communities to be able to tell their own stories and document their own histories in ways that they feel is accurate, and with the goal to enact “a more just present and envisioning new futures” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 5)
\par
“Community Archives Lab found that community archives practices often disrupt the hierarchical models in traditional archives, prompting community members to view collections as belonging to the community and challenging dominant practices and conceptions of custody, description, and ownership.” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 5)
\par
This is already a complete different starting point for participatory processes and practices. Although the communities in question of have the necessary skillset to build and maintain archives, they often lack the resources (time and money) to do so properly. Positive exposure in academic research could ease the funding procedures.
\par
\emph{Community Engaged Research} (CER), \emph{community based participatory research} (CBPR) and \emph{participatory action research} (PAR) are sets of methods and procedures to ensure commitment and relationship building with researched communities. PAR especially focused on affecting change through the research process.
\par
“The Australian project Rights in Records by Design uses a PAR approach to co-design records systems to support the needs of people who experienced out-of-home care.” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 6)
\par
\textbf{Discussion of }\textbf{“Methodology”}\textbf{ (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 7)}
\par
\subsection{Findings}

\par
1. Current state
\par
Despite having had good experiences with research and researchers, community archives are often exploited by academic research, without deeper involvement of the researcher or research project in the community and/or its archive. Problems include extraction, not acknowledging the work done by the community, structural power and financial ~imbalances, abusive consent-procedures, ignoring community knowledge and protocols. 
\par
2. Principles for building mutually beneficial relationships
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item 
“Relational Consent” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 11)

\item 
“Mutual Benefit” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 12)

\item 
“Long-term Investment” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 13)

\item 
“Humility” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 14)

\item 
“Accountability” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 15)

\item 
“Transparency” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 16)

\item 
“Equity” (Caswell et al., 2021, p. 16)

The book takes us beyond the sustainable design field's established focus on energy and materials, to engage the underlying psychological phenomena that shape patterns of consumption and waste. In fluid and accessible writing, the author asks: why do we discard products that still work? He then moves forward to define strategies for the design of products that people want to keep for longer. Along the way we are introduced to over twenty examples of emotional durability in smart phones, shoes, chairs, clocks, teacups, toasters, boats and other material experiences. Emotionally Durable Design transcends the prevailing doom and gloom rhetoric of sustainability discourse, to pioneer a more hopeful, meaningful and resilient form of material culture. This second edition features pull-out quotes, illustrated product examples, a running glossary and comprehensive stand firsts; this book can be read cover to cover, or dipped in-and-out of. It is a daring call to arms for professional designers, educators, researchers and students from in a range of disciplines from product design to architecture; framing an alternative genre of design that reduces the consumption and waste of resources by increasing the durability of relationships between people and things"--Page 4 de la couverture.},

  abstract = {Although scores of articles and books have been written on what constitutes good writing in academia, we’ve granted far less attention to academic writing as a daily practice. Yet it is precisely because it is so taken-for-granted that writing as a practice needs to be explored, investigated, and questioned. In this article, I reflect on academic writing as a practice through conversations on writing with researchers in the fields of management and organization studies. By reflecting on the writing processes and practices of others, I offer a lens through which researchers-as-writers can examine their own writing practices, and by so doing, expand their personal repertoires of practices and approaches for producing meaningful texts.},

\subsection{Free Spaces as hackers infrastructures of sociality}

\par
“These are sites where hackers gather, deliberate, and work semiautonomously from the mandates and demands of their day jobs. They qualify as what scholars of social movements designate “free spaces.” Usefully defined by one sociologist as “settings within a community or movement that are removed from the direct control of dominant groups, are voluntarily participated in, and generate the cultural challenge that precedes or accompanies political mobilization”” (Coleman, 2017, p. S94)
\par
“Internet Relay Chat and mailing lists (and BBSes in earlier eras), are not only easy for hackers to set up but are noncommercial zones on an Internet almost dominated today by private interests.” (Coleman, 2017, p. S94)
\par
\subsection{Political subjectivity of hackers}

\par
“the valorization of craftiness, the cultural cultivation of antiauthoritarianism, and the sustenance of fellowship around labor in free spaces.” (Coleman, 2017, p. S95)
\par
“Thus, the major, and perhaps unsurprising, trigger of hacker politicization has come about as a response to aggressive state and corporate hostility toward hackers and their technologies.” (Coleman, 2017, p. S95)
\par
\subsection{View on hackers now}

\par
“This dual push of cultural celebration and authoritarian crackdown seems only, thus far, to have swelled the ranks of hacker activists, maintaining the state antagonism that prompts reaction while elsewhere popularly celebrating those who react.” (Coleman, 2017, p. S97)
\par
\subsection{Hacking and politics}

\par
“While making information publicly available and debating it are undeniably supported by most hackers, many projectsnotably WikiLeaks and Anonymous—challenge the core liberal fantasy that status quo channels of debate and official, legally sanctioned domains of politics (notably the electoral party system) are sufficient to catalyze change. Hacker tactics—as evinced by tool making, legal reformulation, leaking, whistle-blowing, and especially direct action hacking—demonstrate a more forthright, hands-on engagement with politics than might be implied by their embrace of civil liberties. Indeed, time and again, hacker interventions exceed liberal publicity and enter squarely into the realm of action—sometimes even principled illegal direct action.10” (Coleman, 2017, p. S99)
\par
“But in a striking number of endeavors—in activism, in piracy, in software development, and beyond—hackers avoid defining (and thus policing) the broadly defined ideologies that all their participants must share” (Coleman, 2017, p. S99)

Attention is drawn to the distinction between the social and the individual embodiment theses: a language does depend on the form of the bodies of its members but an individual within that community can learn the language without the body.

Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wigley offer a multi-layered exploration of the intimate relationship between human and design and rethink the philosophy of design in a multi-dimensional exploration from the very first tools and ornaments to the constant buzz of social media. The average day involves the experience of thousands of layers of design that reach to outside space but also reach deep into our bodies and brains. Even the planet itself has been completely encrusted by design as a geological layer. There is no longer an outside to the world of design. Colomina’s and Wigley’s field notes offer an archaeology of the way design has gone viral and is now bigger than the world. They range across the last few hundred thousand years and the last few seconds to scrutinize the uniquely plastic relation between brain and artifact. A vivid portrait emerges. Design is what makes the human. It becomes the way humans ask questions and thereby continuously redesign themselves.},

  abstract = {Community archives are archives created or accumulated, described, and/or preserved by individuals and community groups who desire to document their cultural heritage based on shared experiences, interests, and/or identities, sometimes without the traditional intervention of formally trained archivists, historians, and librarians. Instead, the engaged community members determine the scope and contents of the community archive, often with a focus on a significant shared event, such as the Ferguson unrest (2014). Community archives are created in response to needs defined by the members of a community, who may also exert control over how materials are used.Although local and regional societies, churches, and museums have collected community records for generations, community archives increased in number and popularity throughout the 1970s and 1980s, which Anne Gilliland and Andrew Flinn believe may be due in part to increased interest in oral history and community representation in response to the emerging anti-war, anti-establishment, civil rights, and student activism movements of the 1960s.The work of community archives received little recognition from archival scholars until the early 2000s, when several published studies explored the relationships between communities, archives, and collective memory. Jeannette Bastian’s Owning Memory: How a Caribbean Community Lost Its Archives and Found Its History is considered to be one of the most significant of these publications. Bastian discusses the experience of the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Virgin Islanders' efforts to rebuild their “house of memory” after losing local control of nearly all governmental documents and records to their historical and current colonial rulers. Bastian's work introduces several key concepts, including the notion of a "community of records" to acknowledge that communities are entities that both create records and whose input is needed to contextualize the records they create.},

The model conceptualizes the consumer, their activities, environment, and assistive technology as an integrated system in which changing one element affects all other elements in the system. The model can be applied in the design, selection, and evaluation of technology for use by an individual, or as a conceptual model for exploring the influence of assistive technology on participation in daily activities. In this chapter, examples and explanations are given for both “successful” and “failed” technologies with specific reference to the HAAT model.},

I focus in particular on the affordances of the prototype as material culture and sociological theory: prototyping as something that happens to social relationships when one approaches the craft and agency of objects in particular ways. Last, the essay examines the work that prototypes do as figures of suspension and expectation, where they can be seen to function as ‘traps’ for the emergence of compossibility. They offer in this guise a design for contemporary complexity that is at once ‘more than many and less than one’.},

Design justice focuses on the ways that design reproduces, is reproduced by, and/or challenges the matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, and settler colonialism). Design justice is also a growing social movement that aims to ensure a more equitable distribution of design’s benefits and burdens; fair and meaningful participation in design decisions; and recognition of community based design traditions, knowledge, and practices.},

Current technology allows applications to be efficiently distributed and run on mobile and handheld devices, even in cases where computational requirements are significant. As a result, electronic travel aids, navigational assistance modules, text-to-speech applications, as well as virtual audio displays which combine audio with haptic channels are becoming integrated into standard mobile devices. This trend, combined with the appearance of increasingly user-friendly interfaces and modes of interaction has opened a variety of new perspectives for the rehabilitation and training of users with visual impairments. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of these developments based on recent advances in basic research and application development. Using this overview as a foundation, an agenda is outlined for future research in mobile interaction design with respect to users with special needs, as well as ultimately in relation to sensor-bridging applications in general.},

  abstract = {"The meaning of things is a study of the significance of material possessions in contemporary urban life, and of the ways people carve meaning out of their domestic environment. Drawing on a survey of eighty families in Chicago who were interviewed on the subject of their feelings about common household objects, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Eugene Rochberg-Halton provide a unique perspective on materialism, American culture, and the self. They begin by reviewing what social scientists and philosophers have said about the transactions between people and things. In the model of 'personhood' that the authors develop, goal-directed action and the cultivation of meaning through signs assume central importance. They then relate theoretical issues to the results of their survey. An important finding is the distinction between objects valued for action and those valued for contemplation. The authors compare families who have warm emotional attachments to their homes with those in which a common set of positive meanings is lacking, and interpret the different patterns of involvement. They then trace the cultivation of meaning in case studies of four families. Finally, the authors address what they describe as the current crisis of environmental and material exploitation, and suggest that human capacities for the creation and redirection of meaning offer the only hope for survival. A wide range of scholars - urban and family sociologists, clinical, developmental and environmental psychologists, cultural anthropologists and philosophers, and many general readers - will find this book stimulating and compelling." http://www.loc.gov/catdir/description/cam022/81001443.html.},

\begin{itemize}

\item How to we establish empirical measurements if infrastructures are rassist?

\item Daniel ~Armanios comes up with ways on how to measure things.

\item What kind of methods do we need and use to measure inequality.

\item 

\par
Two ways of thinking about infrastructure (in sociology):
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item selection effect: how does infra get sided in certain places differently then others

\item treatment effect: what happens once the bridge is placed

\end{itemize}

\item They found statistical relation between racial inequality and bridges less bridges and more restrictive bridges for people of color

\item hi-profit tech has better bridges with more sidewalks leading to better physic connectivity between individuals in that specific community

\item Armanios brought organizational theory to engineering systems, which have not beet a traditional area of organizational theory.

\item Computational social science helped a lot in testing empirical/statistical questions

\item Sustainability goals were usually studied independent, but there seems to be a lot of interdependence.

\item 

\par
A good example was studying gender inequality in relation to energy in India (\textasciitilde 24:00):
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item If you want to make an argument about equality in terms of gender you need to know energy usage (treatment), not access (selection).

\end{itemize}

\item The frontier is on the trailing edge

\item Ohio River Project: tried to unravel a big spagetti highway juncture and put it better together, but couldn’t because of all the proximity infrastructure. Hence legacy infrastructure is very important and hard to tackle

\item in his work he is inspired by local stories (ie lowering bridges) and tries to give salience to them by empirical analysis. But it’s important to keep the context and not just apply~one analysis of a thing to another context

\item ethnography just means deep hanging, you just go somewhere for a year and chill

\item Sometimes he extrapolates from a story and sees what infrastructure could have helped and if there are similar cases

\item background in organisational sociology and degrees in engineering

\item also goes into the difference between engineer workers (meaningful, rewarding work) and blue collar workers (where the engineers think they want money and job security, but actually the want the same)

\item methods to overcome bias:

\item destiny nock - multidecision making

\item mixed methods

\item how can indigenous cultural system tackle foreign western tech and infrastructure

For example, conversational systems often use female voices in subservient roles. They also exclude marginalized groups, such as non-binary individuals, altogether. Speech recognition systems also have significant gender, race and dialectal biases [14, 15, 19]. Instead, there is an opportunity for these systems to help change gender norms and promote inclusion and diversity as we continue to struggle with gender equality [10], and progress towards LGBTQ+ rights across the globe [13]. However, prior research claims that users strongly dislike voices without clear gender markers or misalignments between a voice and personality [12]. This calls for additional research to understand how voice assistants may be designed to not perpetuate gender bias while promoting user adoption.},

The survey focused on each of the four workshop topics (evaluation, sensing, networking, and mobility). This chapter thus begins with an overview of the survey design in Sect. 9.1 followed by the process that was used to establish survey content in Sect. 9.2. The results for the survey are presented in Sect. 9.3 followed by brief conclusions in Sect. 9.4.A survey on the ethics of assistive technologies was commissioned to identify debatable issues that could facilitate discussion about assistive technologies in a multidisciplinary setting. The survey was designed by a multidis ciplinary group of researchers in assistive technology prior to the workshop. All workshop participants completed the survey, as well as members of the general public. The results of the survey provided data about which issues were non-controversial, and which issues were far less clear.},

“A similarly haunting technological environment can be found today in the photographs, videos and artist renderings of data center interiors that circulate in the mass media. Images of data centers persistently focus on their futuristic furnishings and the high-tech IT equipment they contain, rather than the people that work in these buildings. Viewers encounter empty corridors bathed in blue neon, low-angle shots of mountainous-looking server cabinets and corridors canopied with snake-thick cables. Much like the techno-organic jungle encountered by the Fantastic Four, the lifeforms that operate and maintain these technological ghost towns of cables, computers and cooling equipment are often curiously and uncannily absent.” (“The Data Center as Technological Wilderness − A.R.E.

I like that take on Github. I used to see Github as a set of tools, an online wrapper around git, and then later as a platform.

“GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over eight million people use GitHub to build amazing things together ... GitHub has grown into the world’s largest code host” (Davis, 2015, p. 162)
\par
Besides software:
\par
“At a time when open access and open data have gained incredible momentum, GitHub has become a site for academic transparency. It provides a well-structured place to post code and lightweight data used in a scholarly endeavor, encouraging reproduction of results and reuse in other projects.” (Davis, 2015, p. 163)

\subsection{On Archives and long term preservation}

\par
“Admittedly, digital preservation on the whole is notoriously difficult. But should a Git repository become an archival object, its entire history would be laid bare, the equivalent of every version of an author’s manuscript bundled into one searchable digital item.” (Davis, 2015, p. 164)
\par
“Git is a librarian’s dream tool. It is metadata come to life—metadata that power projects that power cities, metadata that connect people to each other, and metadata that are lightweight yet impressively granular. Learning version control is useful for personal or organizational projects and for advising researchers, and it is a key skill for the libraries and archives of tomorrow.” (Davis, 2015, p. 164)

Telier arrives at a new characterization of the object of design as a web of things; third, I will show how objects then appear as things immersed in actor networks. In the concluding section of this article, I will discuss how this conceptual itinerary suggests new, fruitful directions for thinking about experience and design.},

The aim is to find answers to the following questions: how to design products triggering ‘happiness’ in one’s mind; which product attributes help in the communication of positive emotions; and finally, how to evoke such emotions through a product. In other words, this is an investigation of the 'meaning' that could be designed into a product in order to 'communicate' with the user at an emotional level. A literature survey of recent design trends, based on selected examples of product designs and semantic applications to design, including the results of recent design awards, was carried out in order to determine the common attributes of their design language. A review of Good Design Award winning products that are said to convey and/or evoke emotions in the users has been done in order to define good design criteria. These criteria have been discussed in relation to user emotional responses and a selection of these has been given as examples.},

  abstract = {International Journal of Design, IJDesign, IJD, SCI, SSCI, A\&HCI, Objects often become cherished for their ties to beliefs, experiences, memories, people, places or values that are significant to their owner. These ties can reflect the ways in which we as humans use objects to characterise, communicate and develop our sense of self. This paper outlines our approach to applying product attachment theory to design practices. We created six artefacts that were inspired by interviews conducted with three individuals who discussed details of their life stories. We then evaluated the associations that came to mind for our participants when interacting with these newly designed artefacts to determine whether these links brought meaning to them. Our findings highlight the potential of design to bring emotional value to products by embodying significant aspects of a person’s self-identity. To do so, designers must consider both the importance and authenticity of the associations formed between an object and an individual.},

\textbf{Conclusion}
\par
"Product attachment theory suggests that people develop an attachment to an object for its role in the construction, maintenance or development of an aspect of their self-identity. These objects are often assigned emotional value for their associations to memories, experiences, values, aspirations, people or places. We set out to explore the potential for design to promote the formation of product attachment by developing a process of designing objects with meaningful associations, using the life stories of our intended users as inspiration for the creation of several artefacts. Our evaluation of these artefacts reflected mixed results that highlight the need for designers to consider both the importance of an associated aspect of identity and the authenticity of the embodiment itself to create objects that hold meaning for an individual. We intend for the process and resulting artefacts presented in this paper to inspire designers to further explore the value of meaningful associations in their practice to enrich user-product relationships."}

By allowing AI voice assistants to listen to our most private conversations, we become receptive to their mediated care, while forgetting or ignoring how much these automated interactions have been pre-scripted. With our project Voices and Voids, we reclaim, examine, and ultimately transcode these voice assistant data through interdisciplinary performance and Post-Internet Art. In this paper, we thematically describe 12 vignettes which represent embodied and sonic experiments using a combination of design, data-driven art, cyber crafts, found-object and traditional percussion instruments, spoken word, and movement. We conclude with a discussion of how the experiments worked as a multifaceted whole, and how we used interdisciplinary methods as a central approach.},

People’s preferences, perspectives and goals are fundamental to defining and determining the success of AT. Maximizing the impact of AT in enabling participation requires an individualized and holistic understanding of the value and meaning of AT for the individual, taking a universal model perspective, focusing on the person, in context, and then considering the condition and/or the technology. This paper aims to situate and emphasize people at the centre of AT systems: we highlight personal meanings and perspectives on AT use and consider the role of advocacy, empowerment and co-design in developing and driving AT processes.},

\par
Problems in Source Code Preservation
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Code is hosted everywhere, there is no single point of entry for software projects

\item 
Source code hosting is fragile and close to nobody invest in longterm preservation

\item 
There is no way to work with the whole corpus of open source software code

\end{itemize}

\par
Software heritage wants to tackle that problem by building a 
\par
“common archival infrastructure,” (Di Cosmo and Zacchiroli, 2017, p. 3)
\par
The Software Heritage is built on top of core principles that steer it’s processes
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Their own software will be F/OSS

\item 
Building a system which tolerates errors

\item 
Being non-profit is essential (interesting regarding Github)

\item 
No a priori selection, aka preserve everything

\item 
Source code first, means only code and it’s dev history

\item 
intrinsic identifiers (ids that can be computed from the digital object itself)

\item 
full provenance, 

\end{itemize}

\par
“Source code is clearly starting to be recognized as a rst class citizen in the area of cultural heritage, as it is a noble form of human production that needs to be preserved, studied, curated, and shared. Source code preservation is also an essential component of a strategy to defend against digital dark age scenarii [1, 5] in which one might lose track of how to make sense of digital data created by soware currently in production. For these reasons Inria has established an agreement with UNESCO on source code preservation,3 whose main actions will be carried on in the context of Soware Heritage.” (Di Cosmo and Zacchiroli, 2017, p. 5)

It brings together various literatures that speak to ice as a substance and substantial matter. Second, ice is represented and experienced in a multitude of ways, from oral cultures of indigenous communities living and working in the Arctic and mountainous environments. This matters again because ice as metaphor is often complicitous with the settler colonial framing of empty, unstable and ungoverned spaces. The paper takes this icy interrogation and brings it into contact with the experiences and struggles of Arctic peoples and states alongside non-Arctic states that seek to press their interests in the midst of ongoing melting and thawing. Icy geopolitics is being reconfigured; melting is said to be ‘triggering’ further expressions of territorial colonization and resource extraction and/or commitment towards indigenous autonomy, stewardship and conservation. The territorial volume is being put to work while at the same time it is being melted, thawed, opened and closed by human and more than human forces.},

Academic background seems to not have any influence. The aesthetics of assistive devices was observed as an important factor that influences the adoption or abandonment of the device.Conclusion: Device without negative symbolism but with modern aesthetics (smart glasses) were positively accepted by the participants than the device with traditional aesthetics and symbolisms of visual impairment (white cane). Designers should, therefore, consider aesthetics in addition to functionality in order to avoid the perceived stigma, thereby reducing the chances of device abandonment.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONUnderstanding the factors that influence the perceived stigma associated with assistive technology can help designers and developers to reduce assistive technology abandonment and perceived stigma.Designers need to consider both functionality and aesthetics. While functionality is crucial for the users’ adaptation, aesthetics is important for the users’ positive perceptions.},

Past analyses and discussions, however, have treated OSS projects and their organization mostly as a static phenomenon. Consequently, we do not know how these communities of software developers are sustained and reproduced over time through the progressive integration of new members. To shed light on this issue I report on my analyses of socialization in a particular OSS community. In particular, I document the relationships OSS newcomers develop over time with both the social and material aspects of a project. To do so, I combine two mutually informing activities: ethnography and the use of software specially designed to visualize and explore the interacting networks of human and material resources incorporated in the email and code databases of OSS. Socialization in this community is analyzed from two perspectives: as an individual learning process and as a political process. From these analyses it appears that successful participants progressively construct identities as software craftsmen, and that this process is punctuated by specific rites of passage. Successful participants also understand the political nature of software development and progressively enroll a network of human and material allies to support their efforts. I conclude by discussing how these results could inform the design of software to support socialization in OSS projects, as well as practical implications for the future of these projects.},

  abstract = {A review of popular technology adoption models identified several factors that are likely to influence Voice Activated Personal Assistant (VAPA) use in public spaces. To inform design decisions of how to make the private use of the VAPA in public spaces more acceptable from the users’ point of view, an online survey was conducted to investigate the likelihood of usage of the smartphone VAPA such as Apple’s Siri (compared to the usage of smartphone keyboard) as a function of location (private vs. public) and type of information (private vs. nonprivate). Responses from participants showed that users were more cautious of transmitting private than nonprivate information. This effect of type of information was amplified in the social context of public locations and when using conspicuous methods of information input such as the VAPA. Participants also preferred using the VAPA in private locations and showed no preference of location for keyboard entries. Correlations between likelihood of usage of VAPA and the social acceptability ratings were positive and predicted similar patterns of smartphone usage.}

“Given the situation described above, we must assume that there are many students who are forced to write a thesis so that they may graduate quickly and obtain the career advancement that originally motivated their university enrollment. Some of these students may be as old as 40. They will ask for instructions on how to write a thesis in a month, in such a way as to receive a passing grade and graduate quickly. We should then say resolutely, this book is not for them. If these are their needs, if they are the victims of paradoxical legal circumstances that force them to graduate so they may resolve painful financial matters, they would be much better served by the following options: (a) Invest a reasonable amount of money in having a thesis written by a second party. (b) Copy a thesis that was written a few years prior for another institution. (It is better not to copy a book currently in print, even if it was written in a foreign language.” (Eco et al., 2015, p. 4)

“If the professor is even minimally informed on the topic, he will be aware of the book’s existence. However, submitting in Milan a thesis written in Catania limits the probability of being caught, although it is obviously necessary to ascertain whether the thesis’s advisor held a position in Catania before teaching in Milan. Consequently, even plagiarizing a thesis requires an intelligent research effort.)” (Eco et al., 2015, p. 5)},

  abstract = {Our goal in this paper is to clearly delineate how households currently manage communication and coordination information; this will provide practitioners and designers with a more complete view of information in the home, and how technology embedded within the home can augment communication and coordination of home inhabitants. Through contextual interviews, we identify five types of communicative information: reminders and alerts, awareness and scheduling, notices, visual displays, and resource coordination. These information types are created and understood by home inhabitants as a function of contextual locations within the home. The choice of location is important to the functioning of the home, and is highly nuanced. Location helps home inhabitants understand time: when others need to interact with that information, as well as ownership: who this information belongs to and who should receive it. It also provides them with awareness of the actions and locations of others. These findings resonate and further elaborate on work by other researchers.},

  abstract = {Engaged theory is a methodological framework for understanding social complexity. It takes social life or social relations as its base category, with 'the social' always understood as grounded in 'the natural', including humans as embodied beings. Engaged theory provides a framework that moves from detailed empirical analysis about things, people and processes in the world to abstract theory about the constitution and social framing of those things, people and processes.Engaged theory is one approach within the broader tradition of critical theory. Engaged theory crosses the fields of sociology, anthropology, political studies, history, philosophy, and global studies. At its most general, the term engaged theory is used to describe theories that provide a tool box for engaging with the world while seeking to change it.One lineage of engaged theory is called the 'constitutive abstraction' approach associated with a group of writers publishing in Arena Journal such as John Hinkson, Geoff Sharp (1926–2015), and Simon Cooper.A related lineage of engaged theory has been developed by researchers who began their association through the Centre for Global Research at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia – scholars such as Manfred Steger, Paul James and Damian Grenfell – drawing upon a range of writers from Pierre Bourdieu to Benedict Anderson and Charles Taylor. A group of researchers at Western Sydney University describe their work as 'Engaged Research'.},

The prototype was developed together with recapp IT (https://recapp.ch\hspace{0pt}), who provided their Swiss German speech recognition technology. Voice assistants are gaining importance as future human-computer interfaces in our lives. However, so far, there was no broad adoption in Switzerland. We believe that a significant reason for this is how Swiss German speakers have to interact with these voice assistants. None of today's assistants speaks or understands the various dialects in Switzerland, thus making communicating with them feel unnatural and uncanny. In this project, we propose to build a new text-to-speech model for different Swiss German dialects. Such a synthesis model can be applied in many different contexts beyond voice assistants such as podcasts, article narration, and automatic radio show generation. This work's final outcome will be a model that translates High German text to Swiss German speech. Please note that this is a work in progress.},

With the recent advances in inclusive technology, it is possible to extend the support given to people with visual impairment. This project is proposed to help those people who are blind or visually impaired using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Image and Text Recognition. The idea is implemented through Android mobile app that focuses on voice assistant, image recognition, currency recognition, e-book, chat bot etc. The app is capable to assist using voice command to recognize objects in the surrounding, do text analysis to recognize the text in the hard copy document. It will be an efficient way in which blind people can also interact with the environment with the help of technology and utilize the facilities of the technology.},

As the field of game studies grows, videogame writing is evolving from the mere evaluation of gameplay, graphics, sound, and replayablity, to more reflective writing that manages to convey the complexity of a game and the way it is played in a cultural context.  Introduction to Game Analysis serves as an accessible guide to analyzing games using strategies borrowed from textual analysis. Clara Fernández-Vara’s concise primer provides instruction on the basic building blocks of game analysis—examination of context, content and reception, and formal qualities—as well as the vocabulary necessary for talking about videogames' distinguishing characteristics. Examples are drawn from a range of games, both digital and non-digital—from Bioshock and World of Warcraft to Monopoly—and the book provides a variety of exercises and sample analyses, as well as a comprehensive ludography and glossary.},

\subsection{1 Introduction}

\par
The author Clara Fernández-Vara proposes to read and analyze video games like texts. This brings Barthes Mythologies to mind, which she later in the text confirms.
\par
“provides a classical example of how the concept of text can be applied to activities and artifacts that may also be a form of human expression” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 6)
\par
The concept of text can be applied to the things themselves, to the things surrounding the things (paratexts), to the things reading the things, and so forth.
\par
Can a video game be understood as a way of communication? Yes, and they’re also artifacts that hold values and ideas, which the game’s players interact with. Textual analysis uses inductive reasoning to produce general theories.
\par
This book tries to broaden the discourse and produce a canon of of works related to game studies. Reasons on p.11.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
structural approach: finding patterns in design, topics, aesthetics, etc

\item 
post-structural: concentrating on the process of sense-making while playing, the context and differences

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Building blocks and areas of game analysis}

\begin{itemize}

\item 

\par

\begin{itemize}

\item

\par
Formal Aspects
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Construction

\item 
Rules, controls

\item 
Design, visual styles, etc

\item 
Formalism/Structuralism

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\par
Caillois disinguishes two different styles of play: ludus and paidia. Play that is restricted through rules versus spontaneous improvisation and expression.
\par
\subsubsection{Limit the scope of the analysis}

\par
“What do I want to learn from the game? What is the field of study that I’m approaching it from? Who am I talking to? What do they know about games? What are the aspects of the game that are going to be relevant to the analysis?” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 18)
\par
These are some general but important questions before starting an analysis.
\par
\subsection{2 Preparing for the Analysis}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
estimate how much time you spend on the mayor phases: playing, reading, writing, rewriting

\item 
be source-critical and ensure they’re of good quality

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Playing the game critically {$<$}3}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
choose how to play the game, methodical-wise

\item 
how much playing has to be done for the playing to be “finished”

\item 
critical distance is hard to maintain as a player/writer

\item 
we can also mistake ourselves for an “ideal” (abstract”) player

\item 
phenomenology’s bracketing method can help: self-examination

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
game capital is the knowledge we can aquire about games and playing them; cheats and walkthroughs and similar things count amongst that capital

\item 
game capital belong to the circumstances of play

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Gathering information about the game}

\par
Since no cultural artifact is created and encountered in the void, the context of a game should also be analyzed.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
find what already has been written on the game

\item 
be selective according to the goals (audience, question) you set out

\item 
be source-critical

\end{itemize}

\par
Possible \textbf{context resources} might include:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
game box and manuals

\item 
official websites

\item 
the cabinet of arcade machines

\item 
game reviews (vs. reception, retro reviews); don’t forget print

\item 
academic articles; might be text on genre that includes reference to game

\item 
press release and advertisements in print and other media (tv)

\item 
newspaper articles

\item 
developer diaries, talks and interviews

\item 
development documentation

\item 
design documents and development files

\item 
postmortems

\end{itemize}

\par
It would be helpful to categorize this resources a bit towards research goals.
\par
Another important source in the analysis of games is resorting to pre-existing theories to understand games, as in borrowing theory from other media.
\par
The original system that a game was intended to be played on might be a crucial part of the context analysis (see Duck Hunt and it’s gun-controller). We also might need access to different versions of a game (dev version, prod version, emulated, etc).
\par
\textbf{Secondary sources}
\par
Sometimes games might be (or include) a one-time or limited event. To study these, context becomes essential. Always play the game and if that is not possible, reconstruct as much as possible through it’s paratexts.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Some analysis might need to include player data

\item 
experiential aspects of a video game are essential in order to understand it; spoilers might be in the way of that, but sometimes it will be important to make a point

\end{itemize}

\subsection{3 Areas of Analysis}

\par
“Providing the context helps us situate the game historically, culturally, socially, and economically. Videogames are the product of their time, therefore learning about the socio-cultural and industrial environment in which they were produced is crucial to understand them.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 56)
\par
“An overview of the game’s main defining elements helps readers situate themselves by explaining briefly what the game is about. This section is common to all types of analysis, as we will see in Chapter 6, although focusing exclusively on the content may be the subject of some specific models of journalistic game reviews, which are closer to consumer reports. By taking into account how the game was played, appropriated, and transformed by the community, the analysis also acknowledges that games are a human activity, not merely a set of rules or code in a computer.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 56)
\par
“The formal qualities of the game are not limited to technical specifications, or a breakdown of specific design features that may be typical of some game reviews. An analysis of the formal aspects must inquire how they work, hypothesize why they are there, and most importantly, how they relate to the player’s experience.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 56)
\par
\emph{Beware of intentional fallacy}
\par
“Intentional fallacy is first assuming that one can figure out what the author was thinking when creating a work, then believing that this presupposed intention is the key to deciding the value and meaning of the work.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 57)
\par
\subsubsection{Context}

\par
Building Blocks. The author includes a batch of questions for every building block, that can be used as starting points for inquiries.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
context inside the game; state what you were focusing on within the game (levels, play modes, etc); see gameplay map, p. 62

\item 
production team

\item 
game genre; defined by and associated through “formal features and cultural assumptions” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 67), conventions, play context, fictions used in world building,

\item 
technological context; ie platform (studies)

\item 
socio-historical context; have a look at the dates, such as development, release and when played

\item 
economic context

\item 
audience; linked to formal analysis as well as paratexts

\item 
relations to other media

\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Notes}

Technological Context

\par
“A platform provides a set of limitations, mainly technological, that developers can embrace or work around.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 72)
\par
That is a bit the part that I’m currently interested in. So maybe there is a link to platform studies, as mentioned in the beginning of the sub-chapter on technological context.
\par
“Understanding the platform also helps determine whether a specific aesthetic of the game is a result of the technology or a choice of the developers.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 73)
\par
It might seem, that there is already some work done on this. But how deep? And could there be a question or thesis hidden here?
\par
\subsubsection{Game Overview}

\par
What makes a game “that” game, identifying it and make clear what sets it appart from other games. It’s mainly descriptive, close to reports and personal accounts of gameplay.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
number of players and how they interact; vs versus co; against players, against the game

\item 
rules and goals of the game/game modes

\item 
game mechanics

\item 
spaces of the game

\item 
fictional world of the game; setting for the story

\item 
story; of the world, of the player; explicit or implicit (ie Wipeout); pre-set or emergent

\item 
gameplay experience

\item 
game communities

\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Notes}

\par
“While the rules can dictate how the game works, the mechanics refer to the rules that establish how the player participates in the game.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 98)
\par
\emph{Michael Nitsche on spaces}
\par
“rule-based space: “defined by the mathematical rules that set, for example, physics, sounds, AI, and game level architecture”;” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 100)
\par
“mediated space: “defined by the presentation, which is the space of the image plane and the use of this image including the cinematic form of presentation”;” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 101)
\par
“fictional space: “that lives in the imagination, in other words, the space ‘imagined’ by players from their comprehension of the available images”;” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 101)
\par
“play space: “meaning space of the play, which includes the player and the videogame hardware”;” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 101)
\par
“social space: “defined by interaction with others, meaning the game space of other players affected (e.g. in a multiplayer title).”” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 101)
\par
“The rules that define how objects move in the world indicate the cardinality of the game world; whereas the rules that refer to the movement player mechanics define the cardinality of gameplay.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 102)
\par
\subsubsection{Formal Elements}

\par
Zoom into the game, have a close reading on how it is made, and how these details relate to the player and the player experience.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
rules of the world;

\item 
diegetic vs. extradiegetic rules;

\item 
save games;

\item 
relationship between rules and the fictional world;

\item 
values and procedural rhetoric;

\item 
procedural content vs. hard-coded content;

\item 
game dynamics;

\item 
the gap between the player and the game: mediation;

\item 
control schemes and peripherals;

\item 
difficulty levels/game balance;

\item 
representation (visual design, sound design, and music);

\item 
rule-driven vs. goal-driven games;

\item 
levels and level design;

\item 
choice design;

\item 
cheats/mods/hacks/bugs.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Notes}

\par
There is a lot of overlapping in the building blocks to game over view and formal elements, especially concerning the rules, mechanics and the world of the game. The “verbs” of a game appear often, indicating the importance of looking at the interactive part.
\par
“Design Assessment Framework proposed by Mitgutsch and Alvarado” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 133)
\par
“• Purpose: What is the goal of the game? What is it trying to achieve? What values does it try to transmit?\\
• Content and information: What is the information that the game is trying to get across? What is the game trying to teach?\\
• Game mechanics: What are the rules of the game? What are the main verbs of the game? How hard/difficult is it?\\
• Fiction and narrative: What is the fictional world of the game? How does the context relate to the content it wants to get across?\\
• Aesthetics and graphics: How does the game set up a tone and environment to the player? \\
• Framing: Who is the game intended for? How much are they supposed to know about games before playing? \\
• Cohesiveness: Can we consider the game as using procedural rhetoric? Are the values that the game tries to convey integrated in the mechanics? Does the audience it is intended for actually play this type of game?” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 134)
\par
The discussion of emergence versus progression (rule- vs goal-driven gameplay) was difficult to follow at first, but seems very interesting.
\par
\subsection{6 Writing the Analysis}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Literature Review

\item 

\par
Thesis statement (max two sentences)
\par
“A good thesis statement is going to take you a long way, because the rest of the analysis is providing arguments and evidence to support it.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 175)
\par
\item 
Framing the discussion (audience)

\end{itemize}

\par
\emph{Example analysis:}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Context

\item 
Game overview

\item 
Thesis statement

\item 
Supporting discussion

\item 
Application of theories to explain the game

\item 
Representation

\item 
Conclusion

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Game summary:}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Context: Production team

\item 
Context: Game genre

\item 
Overview: Number of players

\item 
Overview: Description of gameplay 

\item 
Overview: Gameplay experience

\item 
Optional Overview: Story

\item 
Optional Overview: Fictional Story

\item 
Optional Formal: Difficulty

\item 
Optional Formal: Control schemes

\item 
Optional Formal: Representation

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Historical analysis}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Tech context

\item 
Socio-historical context

\item 
Economic context

\end{itemize}

\par
A historical “analysis should give a diachronic sense, i.e.,~reflecting changes through time” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 190)
\par
“How does the game reflect the affordances of the technology it uses?\\
How is the game an artifact that demonstrates the ideology and cultural concerns of the time?\\
How does the game present a virtual recreation of a historical environment?  How do marketing representations condition the way that the game is received?” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 190)
\par
Layers of technology:
\par
“paying special attention to how the game uses technology, breaking it down in five layers, from the most material to the most external—the platform, the game code, the game form (how it plays), the interface, and the reception and operation.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 192)
\par
In a historical analysis you could for for example on the following: production context, reception, platform, or evolution.
\par
\subsubsection{Interpretative Analysis}

\par
“In a way, almost any analysis of a game is going to be an interpretation of what it is about;” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 207)
\par
“This type of analysis mostly resorts to the blocks in the formal qualities area; it is predominantly a formal analysis in which we examine how the formal qualities may point to socio-cultural concepts and events, or may construe a message, contributing to a coherent concept that explains the game. In some cases, it is always good to ground our interpretation with building blocks belonging to the context area to avoid unfounded interpretations.” (Fernández-Vara, 2014, p. 208)
\par

"We grant them an existential status that leads to their inclusion in our moral community and an assignment of rights and protections occasionally approaching those we afford to other people. Dogs have ‘the face of the other’ because we hold them in a high moral favour."

\par
"However, there are also explicit cognitive factors that influence the moral status we assign animals. Sentience is the most important. By this I mean the minimal capacity to have a direct subjective experience of the qualities associated with sensations and accompanying affectual states. More simply put, sentience is the ability to have the feel of a sensory experience. Because of this, sentient beings have the capacity to suffer, and it is this ability that intuitively affects their moral status. Ethicists from Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century to Peter Singer in the 20th have forcefully argued that the capacity of an animal to suffer demands that it be given standing in our moral community. So the question of moral status is tied up in the question of sentience: its definition and its application."

The impetus for such projects arose from a range of motivations but in general all were responding to the desire to document, record and preserve the identity and history of their own locality and community. Some custodians and creators of these collections remain suspicious of the mainstream archival profession and are determined to preserve their independence and autonomous voice by retaining direct ownership and physical custodianship of their collections, at least for the foreseeable future. In this context, seeking to ensure that these valuable materials are preserved and possibly made accessible presents a number of challenges and opportunities, including an encouragement to re-examine some aspects of traditional professional practice. By examining independent community archive activity in the UK, and in particular in London, and its implications for community interaction and identity within the multicultural context of contemporary British culture and society, this article seeks to contribute a different but relevant perspective to international debates about contemporary professional archival theory and practice.},

Currently, the implications of technological and environmental transformations are challenging designers to focus on complex socio-technical systems. This article traces emergent discussions around posthumanism from across a range of disciplines and perspectives, and considers examples from emerging design practices that emphasize the interrelations between human and nonhuman actors. Specifically, this article reviews literature from actor-network theory (ANT), feminist new materialism, object-oriented ontology, non-representational theory, and transhumanism to inform the development of new methodologies and practices in the field of design. Finally, this article presents critiques of posthumanism from critical race theory and decolonial theory to consider how emergent design perspectives might better support values such as equality and justice for humans and nonhumans that have been traditionally ignored in design processes.},

"While not identified explicitly as posthuman design, these examples illustrate that considerations of the nonhuman—whether animals and the natural environment, or things and the artificial world—require new forms of expertise and open up new problems, questions, opportunities, and solutions for the field of design that it is not yet equipped for."

  abstract = {ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The thesis follows my practice based research process as a visual communication designer concerned with visualising deep ecological thought. Throughout this thesis, I apply Timothy Morton’s dark ecology theory that argues that an awareness of negativity and tragic melancholy is  necessary in order to understand our current ecological climate. This mood is integral to closing the gap between internal human involvement and the supposed external environment. The first section Animism - from deep roots to dark loops is devoted to a theoretical unpacking of animism  as a dark contested theory in relation to the darkness of our present ecology in crisis.  In the second section, Aesthetic animism, I discuss my own creative practice as an expression of ecological thought supported by an animist mode of perceiving. Animism is unpacked as an outsider philosophy joins forces with working with waste matter in my art-design practice, more specifically the excrement of the ocean. This text incorporates a synergy between knowledge and visuality, text and designed objects as a means of practicing ecological literacy.  In order to aid the ecology in crisis this text argues for a renewed, modest, prophetic kinship with our environment, that extends a hand towards non-human agents including the earth  within a practice based research process in the realm of visual arts.},

"Gua\^ttari, detaching himself completely from structuralism, g\^» on to elaborate an "enlarged conception of enunciation," which per­ mits the integration of an infinite n\^ber of substances of non-human expresion like biological, t\^echnological, or aesthetic coding, or forms of a»emblage unique to the socius. The problem of assembling enunciation would no longer be spe­ cific to a semiotic register, but would cross over into expressive hetero­ geneous matter (extra-linguistic, non-human, biological, t\^echnological, aesthetic, etc.). Thus, in "machinic \^\^nism," there is not a unique subjectivity embodied by the W est\^ man—male and white—but one of "heterogeneous ontological modes of subj\^trvity."

Becoming Human by Design's provocative argument presents a revised reading of human 'evolution' centred on ontological design. Examining the relation of design to the nature of the human species - where the species came from, how it was created, what it became and its likely future - Fry asserts that current biological and social models of evolution are an insufficient explanation of how 'we humans' became what we are.Making a case for ontological design as an evolutionary agency, the book posits the relation between the formation of the world of human fabrication and the making of mankind itself as indivisible. It also functions as a provocation to rethink the fate of Homo sapiens, recognising that all species are finite and that the fate of humankind turns on a fundamental Darwinian principle - adapt or die. Fry considers the nature of adaptation, arguing that it will depend on an ability to think and design in new ways.}

Initially considered neutral and fair, ML algorithms have recently been found increasingly biased, creating and perpetuating structural inequalities in society. With the rising concerns about algorithmic bias, a growing body of literature attempts to understand and resolve the issue of algorithmic bias. In this tutorial, we discuss five important aspects of algorithmic bias. We start with its definition and the notions of fairness policy makers, practitioners, and academic researchers have used and proposed. Next, we note the challenges in identifying and detecting algorithmic bias given the observed decision outcome, and we describe methods for bias detection. We then explain the potential sources of algorithmic bias and review several bias-correction methods. Finally, we discuss how agents’ strategic behavior may lead to biased societal outcomes, even when the algorithm itself is unbiased. We conclude by discussing open questions and future research directions.},

  abstract = {IN THIS SHORT paper, I attempt to identify some historical factors that combine to explain current differences in certain of the data modelling practices of the archives, library and museum (ALM) communities. I am prompted to do this out of interest in the work of the International Council on Archives’ Experts Group on Archival Description (ICA-EGAD; see Gueguen et al., 2013; Pitti et al., 2014). This group is engaged in the design of a new model of data that is descriptive of archival holdings, with the intention that eventually it shall supersede older models that are deemed less useful in contemporary contexts. Reading between the lines of EGAD's ‘Interim Report’, some observers initially speculated that this new model may be more in line with those developed in the library and (in particular) the museum communities.It occurred to me that a historical analysis might help us to weigh up the pros and cons of adopting the new model. It certainly seems prudent to ask in what ways such a development might be construed as a positive one whose benefits outweigh its costs; and my assumption is that a historical analysis could help us to answer that question. If we were to come to an understanding of the historical conditions for the distinctive direction taken by developers of archival standards since 1987 (so the argument goes), and compare them with advances made in libraries and museums, then that would help us to account for differences in the data models that have been produced in each domain, and perhaps also help us to understand the need for a new archival model.There is an ethical subtext to all of this, which arises from asking the question whether, ceteris paribus, data models should be (a) more like one another or (b) less like one another than they currently are. My characterization of this as an ethical question derives from a conviction that one's answer will depend on how much one values uniformity above or below diversity.

The author thinks, that he has not enough temporal distance from the things he is about to analyze. (Furner, 2016, p. 42) I find the extend to which he is stating that quite interesting, funny almost.
\par
There are different approaches to the analysis that need to be considered, and a proper analysis will factor in several of them:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
interactionist, agent-oriented focusing on human actors

\item 
functionalist, artifact-oriented

\item 
structuralist, domain-oriented focusing on disciplinary traditions and customs

\end{itemize}

\subsection{What are data models}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
1960s data structure class to be used in descriptions

\item 
or 1980s as a schema

\item 
as conceptual schema, simplifying real things

\item 
or as schema of other kinds, meaning data of those things that may be collected

\end{itemize}

\par
Usually, library management systems start with a resource/authority distinction.
\par
\subsection{Some history}

\par
A shared unified data model came about only after mid 1980. After that ALM started to bring into being their own data models.
\par
In the development of these different models and subsequently standards, the different needs of the different domains became apparent. Archival descriptions are about access to collections, rather than item-level objects. Especially Weber wrote about this in her 1993 paper.
\par
In the end it should come down to users needs.
\par
“Whoever the users are for whom the standards were designed, we must study their use of the descriptions and the implementations we offer, and be ready to evolve these standards and implementations in response to needs. ... No standards deserve to be implemented as a strategy to improve access unless they can be shown to work. ... Only empirical evidence should be accepted as an argument for standards if the standards are intended to promote access through automated systems. In all aspects of the standardization process, we must stoutly resist introducing requirements that have no warrant in archival practices and that will return few, if any, benefits.” (Furner, 2016, p. 58)},

We argue, in contrast, that it is a resource for design that can be used to encourage close personal engagement with systems. We illustrate this with examples from contemporary arts and design practice, and distinguish three broad classes of ambiguity according to where uncertainty is located in the interpretative relationship linking person and artefact. Ambiguity of information finds its source in the artefact itself, ambiguity of context in the sociocultural discourses that are used to interpret it, and ambiguity of relationship in the interpretative and evaluative stance of the individual. For each of these categories, we describe tactics for emphasising ambiguity that may help designers and other practitioners understand and craft its use.},

Ziel ist es, nach dem Master ein Buch zu publizieren welches dieses Thema zugänglich und vermittelnd aufgreift. Monster sind Symbole der Differenz. Sie stehen für das Fremde, das noch Unbekannte, für das was irgendwie anders ist. Was wir (noch) nicht kennen ist uns nicht geheuer, oder eben ungeheuerlich. Monster stehen dafür, was von der konstruierten menschlichen Norm abweicht. Aber dadurch zeigen sie uns auch auf, dass diese Normen vom Menschen konstruiert sind und es Möglichkeiten und Existenzen ausserhalb dieser vermeintlichen norm gibt. Sie haben das potential genau diese konstruierten Normen zu kritisieren von denen sie abweichen. Dadurch sind sie ein spannendes Mittel um über das Menschsein nachzudenken. Durch ihre visuelle Eigenart haben sie zudem grosses Potential um in Illustration eingesetzt zu werden. Denn Monster sind gerade über ihr Äusseres als monströs gekennzeichnet. Sie werden gezeigt, vorgeführt, imaginiert, gesehen und sie existieren schliesslich vor allem in diesem Zustand des “Gesehenwerdens”. Durch ihre konträre visuelle Eigenart sind die ungeheuerlichen Kreaturen ein fruchtbares Terrain, um als Kritik an vorherrschenden Stereotypen und Rollenbildern in Illustration eingesetzt zu werden. Die Master-Thesis Monsters and Others verbindet Monster- und Gender-Theorie mit Illustration auf eine neue Weise und gibt spannende Einblicke in Theorie und Praxis.},

One term in particular, ‘platform,’ reveals the contours of this discursive work. ‘Platform’ has been deployed in both their populist appeals and their marketing pitches – sometimes as technical platforms, sometimes as platforms from which to speak, sometimes as platforms of opportunity. Whatever tensions exist in serving all of these constituencies are carefully elided. The term also fits their efforts to shape information policy, where they seek protection for facilitating user expression, yet also seek limited liability for what those users say. As these providers become the curators of public discourse, we must examine the roles they aim to play, and the terms with which they hope to be judged.},
  langid = {english},
  keywords = {Read,Relevant},
  note = {\section{Notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Platforms in between the public and the commercial private

\end{itemize}

\par
“The term ‘platform’ helps reveal how YouTube and others stage themselves for these constituencies, allowing them to make a broadly progressive sales pitch while also eliding the tensions inherent in their service: between user-generated and commercially produced content, between cultivating community and serving up advertising, between intervening in the delivery of content and remaining neutral.” (Gillespie, p. 3)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Platform is a misrepresentation of what YouTube really is

\end{itemize}

\par
Todays usage of platform by YouTube is depending on four categories (p. 3)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Computational

\item 
Architectural

\item 
Figurative

\item 
Political

\end{itemize}

\par
Taken together, they speak of advantages for those who participate with a particular platform.
\par
“Drawing these meanings together, ‘platform’ emerges not simply as indicating a functional shape: it suggests a progressive and egalitarian arrangement, promising to support those who stand upon it.” (Gillespie, p. 4)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
The term is used inflationary in the tech industry.

\item 
There seems to be a commercial transformation of platform

\end{itemize}

\par
“Platforms are platforms not necessarily because they allow code to be written or run, but because they afford an opportunity to communicate, interact, or sell.” (Gillespie, p. 5)
\par
“In classic O’Reilly style, he draws a term from the computational lexicon, further loosens it from the specific technical meaning, and layers onto it both a cyber-political sense of liberty and an info-business taste of opportunity.” (Gillespie, p. 6)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
At least in 2009 it was unclear to most users, that youtube gets it’s money from ads. Or that youtube needs to earn money in the first place.

\end{itemize}

\par
YouTube has three majors audiences and needs to discurse between them, and platform seems to work.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
end users

\item 
advertisers

\item 
professional content producers

\end{itemize}

\par
Besiders speaking to “customers” of all couleurs, the term platform als carries with dangerous functions towards policy making.
\par
“This is not just in the words of the rulemakers themselves. Interested third parties, particularly the companies that provide these services, are deeply invested in fostering a regulatory paradigm that gives them the most leeway to conduct their business, imposes the fewest restrictions on their service provision, protects them from liability for things they hope not to be liable for, and paints them in the best light in terms of the public interest.” (Gillespie, p. 10)
\par
In the end, ‘platform’ is used as nothing more as to say ‘we’re essential, but we’re not responsible for what is built on us’. It’s also a term very deliberately chosen for it’s ability to navigate all these discourses.
\par
\subsection{Besprechung}

\par
“But the way in which an information distribution arrangement is characterized can matter much more, beyond it merely fitting the necessary sales pitch or taking hold as part of the public vernacular. These terms and claims get further established, reified, and enforced as they are taken up and given legitimacy inside authoritative discourses such as law, policy, and jurisprudence.” (Gillespie, p. 9)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
How is this important

\end{itemize}

\par
“Drawing these meanings together, ‘platform’ emerges not simply as indicating a functional shape: it suggests a progressive and egalitarian arrangement, promising to support those who stand upon it.” (Gillespie, p. 4)
\par
\section{Hello World}

\par
“It should come as no surprise then that the term would again gain traction around usergenerated content, streaming media, blogging, and social computing. There has been a proliferation of ‘platforms’ just in online video: the visible ones whose names are known to users, such as YouTube, Veoh, Revver, MTV’s Flux” (Gillespie, p. 5)},

Arguing that repair and maintenance activities present a kind of 'missing link' in social theory, which is usually overlooked or forgotten, the article begins by recalling Heidegger's concept of material things as being 'ready to hand'. The main elements of practices of repair and maintenance are then elaborated on so as to help establish the argument that, by focusing on failure and breakdown in technical artefacts and systems, their vital contribution can be brought to the fore. The article then moves on to suggest that prevailing cultural constructions, and imaginations, of the 'infrastructure' that sustains modern societies, actively work to push repair and maintenance activities beyond the attention of social science. To exemplify these arguments, the article explores in detail some of the repair and maintenance activities that sustain, first, the nexus between computer communications and electricity and, second, the system of automobility. The article concludes by excavating a politics of repair and maintenance in modern cities and societies.},

But the notion of fetishism originates in a very different context, and in many ways, an incommensurable system of thought—animism. Returning to this submerged backstory, I deploy the concept of the fetish to confront the recent enthusiasm for materiality that has emerged in response to current environmental crises. New materialism considers matter to have a liveliness not dependent on human subjects. This paper considers what divides “vital materialism” from the “animist materialism” that continues to structure everyday experience in a range of contexts in Africa and elsewhere and investigates the way in which fetishism, within the intellectual tradition of animism, alerts us to the strange ephemeralness of the avowed materialism of the new materialist project.},

  abstract = {Edited by Richard Grusin of the Center for 21st Century Studies, this is the first book to name and characterize-and therefore consolidate-a wide array of current critical, theoretical, and philosophical approaches to the humanities and social sciences under the concept of the nonhuman turn. Each of these approaches is engaged in decentering the human in favor of a concern for the nonhuman, understood by contributors in a variety of ways-in terms of animals, affectivity, bodies, materiality, technologies, and organic and geophysical systems.  The nonhuman turn in twenty-first-century studies can be traced to multiple intellectual and theoretical developments from the last decades of the twentieth century: actor-network theory, affect theory, animal studies, assemblage theory, cognitive sciences, new materialism, new media theory, speculative realism, and systems theory. Such varied analytical and theoretical formations obviously diverge and disagree in many of their assumptions, objects, and methodologies. However, they all take up aspects of the nonhuman as critical to the future of twenty-first-century studies in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.  Unlike the posthuman turn, the nonhuman turn does not make a claim about teleology or progress in which we begin with the human and see a transformation from the human to the posthuman. Rather, the nonhuman turn insists (paraphrasing Bruno Latour) that "we have never been human," that the human has always coevolved, coexisted, or collaborated with the nonhuman-and that the human is identified precisely by this indistinction from the nonhuman.

Zu Wort kommen somit verschiedene, durchaus konträre Positionen zu dieser Perspektive der ‚Objektbiographie‘ auf Materielle Kultur und Objektschicksale. Damit eröffnet der Band auch einen Einblick in die Reflexion und aktuelle Kritik dieses Deutungsansatzes in den verschiedenen Fächern, sowie Versuche, diesen Zugang zu einem möglichen Verständnis des Materiellen für spezifische Fragestellungen fruchtbar zu machen.},

  abstract = {How can we develop products that consumers want to use for longer? The lifetime of electrical products is an ongoing concern in discussions about the circular economy. It is an issue that begins at an industry level, but that directly influences the way in which consumers use and discard products. Through a series of workshops and knowledge exchange sessions with Philips Lighting, this paper identifies which design factors influence a consumer’s tendency to retain their products for longer. These were distilled into a guiding framework for new product developers—The Emotional Durability Design Nine—consisting of nine themes: relationships, narratives, identity, imagination, conversations, consciousness, integrity, materiality, and evolvability. These nine themes are complemented by 38 strategies that help in the development of more emotionally engaging product experiences. We propose that the framework can be applied at multiple points during the new product development process to increase the likelihood that ‘emotion building’ features are integrated into an end product.},

The~research findings are examined through the analytical lenses generated~during the research process with the idea of following how the~internal abilities related to moving between different levels of~attention influenced the formation of the visible outcomes and thus~the emergence of the new. In light of the current global pressures for~change toward human and planetary sustainability and the~capacity-building needs emphasizing new inner postures and abilities~to act from broader ecosystem awareness, the paper provides real-world~examples of what new ways of becoming with the world could look like~in practice, as everyday activities and choices.},

This view allows identifying five fundamental approaches to methods: black-box, procedural, artefact-centric, formal and managerial approaches. They all describe method structure but emphasise different aspects of it. Capturing these differences addresses common terminological confusions relating to methods. The paper provides an overview of the use of the fundamental method approaches for different purposes in designing. In addition, the FBS ontology is used for developing a notion of prescriptiveness of design methods as an aggregate construct defined along four dimensions: certainty, granularity, flexibility and authority. The work presented in this paper provides an ontological basis for describing, understanding and managing design methods throughout their life cycle.},

Es zeigen sich dabei sprachliche und kulturelle Praktiken, die durch die Integration artifizieller Mündlichkeit in die Interaktion entstehen, wie sie bisher noch nicht beschrieben werden konnten. Diese untersucht der gesprächslinguistisch ausgerichtete Teilbereich des Projekts B06 „Un/erbetene Beobachtung in Interaktion: ,Intelligente Persönliche Assistenten‘ (IPA)“ im Sonderforschungsbereich „Medien der Kooperation“ an der Universität Siegen. Sprachassistenzsysteme sind außerdem für ihre Funktionalität auf die dauerhafte Beobachtung des häuslichen Umfelds angewiesen. Die Reflexion der NutzerInnen über dieses „Mithören“, das im öffentlichen Diskurs teilweise sehr kritisch betrachtet wird, steht ebenfalls im Fokus der im Projekt durchgeführten Untersuchungen. Im Rahmen der hier vorgestellten Pilotstudie werden methodische Prämissen im Hinblick auf das Vorgehen bei der Datenerhebung reflektiert und aus den gewonnenen Daten erste Anhaltspunkte für die sprachwissenschaftlichen Analysekategorien herauskristallisiert. Der Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf der Identifikation von sprachlich-interaktionalen Praktiken und deren Einbettung in soziokulturelle Praktiken, die in der Hauptstudie ebenfalls näher beleuchtet werden sollen. Unsere Daten zeigen, dass Interagierende ein Sprachassistenzsystem nicht wie einen zusätzlichen Gesprächsteilnehmer in die Interaktion einbeziehen, sondern es durchaus wie ein technisches Gerät behandeln. Gleichzeitig scheint die parallele Nutzung des medial mündlichen Kanals zur Bedienung eines Geräts auf der einen und zum Führen einer Konversation auf der anderen Seite Auswirkungen auf das Repertoire sprachlich-interaktionaler sowie kultureller Praktiken zu haben.},

Using EverQuest, EverQuest II, and World of Warcraft as illustrative of a timeline of character creation design trends, this article argues that the disappearance of blackness is a gradual erasure facilitated by multicultural design strategies and regressive racial logics. Contemporary fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) privilege whiteness and contextualize it as the default selection, rendering any alterations in coloration or racial selection exotic stylistic deviations. Given the Eurocentrism inherent in the fantasy genre and embraced by MMORPGs, in conjunction with commonsense conceptions of Blacks as hyper-masculine and ghettoized in the gamer imaginary, players and designers do not see blackness as appropriate for the discourse of heroic fantasy. As a result, reductive racial stereotypes and representations proliferate while productive and politically disruptive racial differences are ejected or neutralized through fantastical proxies.},

The use of digital collections for scholarship – using ICT based tools and methods – has been the basis of transformative and innovative research across the disciplines, allowing enhanced access to materials, and supporting new modes of collaboration and communication. Digital collections development has required a huge investment of public and private funding, and has, in turn, engendered an even greater requirement for continued investment to expand, enhance and augment the existing digital knowledge base, and to embed these collections in research and scholarship.

The “politics of ontologies” associated with this movement in anthropology opens up the question of participation of non-humans. This article contrasts this anthropological attempt with the work of the philosopher Gilbert Simondon, who wants to overcome the antagonism between culture and technics. According to Simondon, this antagonism results from the technological rupture of modernity at the end of the eighteenth century. This paper analyses the differences of the oppositions presenting their work: culture vs. nature, culture vs. technics, to show that a dialogue between anthropology of nature (illustrated through the work of Philippe Descola) and philosophy of technology (illustrated through the work of Simondon) will be fruitful to conceptualize a renewed relation between nature and technology. One way to initiate such a conversation as well as to think about the reconciliation between nature and technology, this article tries to show, is to develop the concept of cosmotechnics as the denominator of these two trends of thinking.},

This article explores how we might progress with a methodology born in an age of early globalisation, when tracing things was easier and more surprising than today. It suggests that attempting to understand the unfollowable bits of the commodity trail may be an apposite way to go about such studies, especially in the light of the fact that globalisation is now a well-established phenomenon and capitalism’s precarious nature shows no sign of abating.},

  abstract = {Human-centered design (HCD) [also Human-centred design, as used in ISO standards] is an approach to problem solving, commonly used in design and management frameworks that develops solutions to problems by involving the human perspective in all steps of the problem-solving process. Human involvement typically takes place in observing the problem within context, brainstorming, conceptualizing, developing, and implementing the solution. Human-centred design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance. ISO 9241-210:2019(E) Human-centered design builds upon participatory action research by moving beyond participants' involvement and producing solutions to problems rather than solely documenting them. Initial stages usually revolve around immersion, observing, and contextual framing in which innovators immerse themselves with the problem and community. Consequent stages may then focus on community brainstorming, modeling and prototyping, and implementation in community spaces. Further, human-centered design typically focuses on integrating technology or other useful tools in order to alleviate problems, especially around issues of health. Once the solution is integrated, human-centered design usually employ system usability scales and community feedback in order to determine the success of the solution.},

Our research draws on cultural analysis of Hollywood and international films, television and literature, and observations from our personal experiences with voice assistants. We argue that designers of devices like the Google Home and Amazon Echo inherited a cultural imaginary of alien and dangerous robots with artificial voices and personalities. Manufacturers leveraged techniques of modality, personae and invocation and pre-existing social connotations of the voice to create positive associations of these devices in the home. We conclude by arguing that smart voice assistants are new media innovations prepared for consumers through pre-domestication and represent an emerging regime of power and influence based on technologised voice interaction.},

  abstract = {Small, local, independent, and oftentimes idiosyncratic, the many community archives across the globe are commonly considered the least prepared to undertake digital preservation activities. Taking up the concept of archives as a “place of preservation” and putting it in conversation with the distinct areas of scholarship on community archives and cloud computing, I argue that community archives are enabled by cloud-computing solutions to begin acquiring and preserving born-digital records. To do so means re-imagining the boundaries of where preservation takes place. I outline the concepts that define community archives in the Anglo-American context, discuss these ideas in relation to preservation and place, and connect them with a review of potential cloud-computing implementations and case examples for small archives. Embedded alongside records creators that represent a broad spectrum of organizations, people, and interests, community archives are ideally positioned to acquire the digital records of persons, businesses, and organizations that may escape large, institutionally based archives. The very distributed nature of community archives will enable them to contribute to a more networked approach to digital preservation, one that reflects the networked structure of cloud computing itself.RÉSUMÉPetits, locaux, indépendants et souvent singuliers, les nombreux centres d’archives communautaires de par le monde sont communément considérés comme les moins bien préparés à entreprendre des activités de préservation numérique. En me servant du concept des archives comme « endroit de préservation » et en le plaçant en dialogue avec des champs distincts de la littérature scientifique par rapport aux archives communautaires et à l’informatique en nuage, je soutiens que les solutions de l’informatique en nuage ont permis aux archives communautaires de commencer à acquérir et à préserver les documents créés en format numérique. Arriver à le faire nécessite de repenser les limites de l’endroit où s’effectue la préservation. Je présente les concepts qui définissent les archives communautaires dans le contexte angloaméricain, je discute de ces idées en relation avec préservation et endroit, et je les lie à un survol des solutions potentielles de l’informatique en nuage et à des études de cas pour des petits centres d’archives. Bien ancrés comme ils le sont parmi les créateurs de documents qui représentent une grande étendue d’organisation, de personnes et d’intérêts, les centres d’archives communautaires sont très bien placés pour acquérir les documents numériques de personnes, de sociétés et d’organisations qui pourraient ne pas être ciblées par les grands centres d’archives institutionnalisés. La nature distribuée des archives communautaires leur permettra de contribuer davantage à une approche de réseautage pour effectuer la préservation numérique, une approche qui reflétera la structure de réseautage de l’informatique en nuage elle-même.},

\par
Until 1990 (and onwards until this paper) relatively little effort was made to understand the users and usage of archives and archival methods. It was assumed that it was archivists and historians that know their way around.
\par
The actual user base has changed in the last thirty years:
\par
“a significant portion of visitors are at the moment people looking for information instead of data” (Huvila, 2008, p. 17)
\par
The differentiation between information and data is relevant. Archivist and historians are gather information from data themselves, whereas others often don’t have the necessary skills, knowledge or processes at hand to do so.
\par
The change in user base is linked to the growth of records, but also new services and of course, digitization. Further, the public’s stance towards archives has changed.
\par
“Following the argument of Ketelaar (1992), archives and information are more of the people, by the people, and for the people than the people are for the archives.” (Huvila, 2008, p. 18)
\par
In a post-modern view, the neutrality of an archive isn’t given anymore. There is a pluriverse of viewpoints at hands.
\par
\subsection{Digital archives at Saari Manor and Kajaani Castle}

\subsubsection{Methods and strategy}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
unstructured expert interviews

\item 
requirement engineering, validated with experts and potential user group (n=15)

\item 
qualitative document analysis (Altheide)

\item 
development of indexing and classification

\end{itemize}

\par
“The central themes which appeared in the discussions were geographical dispersion of individual users, existence of multiple parallel viewpoints, interpretations of each information object, variety of the types of relevant information objects (ranging from manuscripts to physical objects and measurement data), and the fact that expertise in different aspects of the information objects was held by different individuals.” (Huvila, 2008, p. 20)
\par
This snippet feels so relevant…
\par
\subsubsection{Findings, Requirements}

\par
The following requirements were extracted from the “principal findings” (Huvila, 2008, p. 20).
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Multiuser browsing, editing, and maintenance

\item 
Versions and tracking of changes on the level of individual contributors

\item 
Flexibility of data and structure

\item 
Flexibility of description

\item 
Searchability and formalisation of decriptions

\item 
Standard file formats

\item 
Standard, inexpensive, and easily transferable software

\end{itemize}

\par
From an infrastructural view, the balance between flexibility part is extremely interesting. It seems to be about including unknown future cases. In the end they chose a the semantic mediawiki as base for their platform :)
\par
\subsection{Envisioning a participatory archive}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
self-steering, as in crowd

\item 
emphasis on collaborativeness and conversationality of archive building

\item 
easy entry and total findability

\item 
supervision has only maintenance function, not value judgment or facilitation

\end{itemize}

\par
“Unlike in the access paradigm of Menne-Haritz (2001), a participatory archive pursues transparency through participation and not its opposite. Inclusion and greater participation are supposed to reveal a diversity of motivations, viewpoints, arguments and counterarguments, which become transparent when a critical mass is attained.” (Huvila, 2008, p. 25)
\par
Further, a participatory archive is characterized by
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item 
Decentralized curation

\item 
Radical user orientation

\item 
Contextualization of both records and the entire archival process

\end{enumerate}

\par
Infrastructural participation:
\par
“In a participatory archive, the usability does not denote use alone, but also denotes a deeper level of involvement in the sense of actual participation in the archive and in the archival process.” (Huvila, 2008, p. 25)
\par
A similar project incorporates participatory approaches through functions like “commenting, collaborative filtering, bookmarking, and visitor awareness” (Huvila, 2008, p. 25). User awareness is implemented differently in the present study and regarded through “following changes and contributions rather than browsing and the movement throughout a site” (Huvila, 2008, p. 26). There is importance in what user engagement is tracked and categorized as participatory. See also Nick Seaver on user tracking (Seaver, 2021).
\par
There is a lot to unpack in the described differences between the “participatory archiving model” (Huvila, 2008, p. 26) by Shilton and Srinivasan and the proposed participatory archive. I’ll include the text directly.
\par
“The first difference in the approaches is that Shilton and Srinivasan seem to discuss essentially building, appraisal, provenance, ordering and description of an archival collection, and participatory development of archival ontologies instead of working with an archive as an evolving corpus of process-bound information with self-emerging ontologies. The second major difference is that in the participatory archiving model, communities are an actor, and the archive will be based on a consensual community ontology of the participating community members set within a theoretical framework based on archival science. In a participatory archive, there is no predetermined consensual community. The ‘community’ is a sum of all individual structures, descriptions, orders, and viewpoints contributed by individual participating archive users whether they are users or contributors, archivists, researchers, administrators, labourers, or belong to marginalised communities or the majority. The proposed role for information managers is to maintain the technical platform, to provide adequate tools for working with the archive and to provide a minimum technical level of findability of individual records. Otherwise than from the technical point of view, information managers are equal to the other users of the archive. Their role is not to direct the process of how an archive emerges, how something is described or appraised or what provenances relate to the materials.” (Huvila, 2008, p. 26)
\par
It essentially boils down to who has the authority to manage the archives content – the archivists or the community.
\par
“postcontrolled” (Huvila, 2008, p. 26) 😍
\par
Seen from this vantage point, enabling users to simply contact the archive through mail or contact forms (as seen with many participatory archive projects) is simply not enough. The discussion and authority of publicity still lies within the archive and the public is excluded.
\par
The role of the archivist in a participatory archive shifts and is still crucial. See “responsibilities” (Huvila, 2008, p. 27).
\par
\subsection{Discussion and conclusion}

\par
Yes… that’s the gist of it
\par
“The most essential question regarding a participatory archive is whether it works or not: whether the users contribute to an archive and whether the contributions create added value. According to the earlier studies on collaborative digital information repositories, the functional sustainability of a repository is highly dependent on the activity of archive users and the emergence of a culture of collaboration, integration into daily practises, and a critical mass to sustain necessary level of contributions, which obliges others to contribute (Peddibhotla and Subramani 2007; Hollingshead et al. 2002; Dingsøyr and Røyrvik 2003).” (Huvila, 2008, p. 30)},

Individual and collective cultural identity within government and private archives can be enabled through a participatory approach which acknowledges record subjects as record co-creators. This article analyses cultural human rights instruments found in international and domestic Australian laws as warrants for a participatory archive within the Australian context, premised on the recognition of the rights of those who are subjects of the record to add their own narratives to records held in archival institutions, and to participate as co-creators in decision-making about appraisal, access and control, thus shaping and reshaping the archive from their perspective. To this end, it proposes the use of social media to enhance cultural rights and cultural identity. Adopting the principle of rights maximisation, a participatory approach lessens the impact of the right to be forgotten on cultural rights. The article concludes that Australian archival policy makers and jurisdictions which have a human rights regime, have a clear mandate to give priority to the preservation of records of distinctive cultures, in particular those of Indigenous peoples and minorities.},

  abstract = {PROSPECT In his notebooks the painter Paul Klee repeatedly insisted, and demonstrated by example, that the processes of genesis and growth that give rise to forms in the world we inhabit are more important than the forms themselves. “Form is the end, death”, he wrote. “Form-giving is movement, action. Form-giving is life” (Klee 1973: 269). This, in turn, lay at the heart of his celebrated “Creative Credo” of 1920: “Art does not reproduce the visible but makes visible” (Klee 1961: 76). It does not, in other words, seek to replicate finished forms that are already settled, whether as images in the mind or as objects in the world. It seeks, rather, to join with those very forces that bring form into being. Thus the line grows from a point that has been set in motion, as the plant grows from its seed. Taking their cue from Klee, philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari argue that the essential relation, in a world of life, is not between matter and form, or between substance and appearance, but between materials and forces (Deleuze \& Guattari 2004: 377). It is about the way in which materials of all sorts, with various and variable properties, and enlivened by the forces of the cosmos, mix and meld with one another in the generation of things. And what they seek to overcome in their rhetoric is the lingering influence of a way of thinking about things, and about how they are made and used, that has been around in the Western world for the past two millennia and more. It goes back to Aristotle.}

  abstract = {Animism is often described as the imputation of life to inert objects. Such imputation is more typical of people in western societies who dream of finding life on other planets than of indigenous peoples to whom the label of animism has classically been applied. These peoples are united not in their beliefs but in a way of being that is alive and open to a world in continuous birth. In this animic ontology, beings do not propel themselves across a ready-made world but rather issue forth through a world-in-formation, along the lines of their relationships. To its inhabitants this weather-world, embracing both sky and earth, is a source of astonishment but not surprise. Re-animating the ‘western’ tradition of thought means recovering the sense of astonishment banished from official science.},

However, the challenge has been translating social equity concerns into metrics that are usable in engineering analyses. In this case study, the authors aim to identify such metrics that can be subsequently used by engineers who seek to make equity-informed infrastructure construction, replacement, and rehabilitation decisions. Combining geospatial and statistical techniques on publicly available data sources, this research proposes a quantitative framework for how to incorporate social equity metrics into infrastructure analyses. The feasibility of this framework is analyzed in the case of Pennsylvania’s bridge system. This feasibility study finds that selection effects (i.e.,~factors that drive bridge siting) are stronger than treatment effects (i.e.,~changes that occur after bridge construction) of bridges on social equity. Consistent variables are also identified as correlated with such effects (e.g.,~demographic and, to a lesser degree, family variables). Overall, this research proposes measures and an approach that helps local government transportation agencies better incorporate social equity into infrastructure construction, replacement and rehabilitation.},

The objectives are to understand the technologies used for addressing the needs of PWD by identifying relevant criteria for the assessment, explore the implications of these technologies in their lives and identify the gaps among certain technologies in assisting PWD. In this article, we reviewed around 40 research scientific papers in relation to the technologies used to assist PWD in their daily activities. A novel quantitative assessment methodology based on Multi-weighted Scoring Model (MWSM) has been developed. It is based on the judgement of clinical experts according to thirteen well-defined criteria. The proposed method is useful because it assesses the scientific studies related to PWD qualitatively according to efficient research coverage, as well as quantitatively in order to have good comparative judgment. Moreover, this method recognizes the research gap or areas which need further investigation and identifies the research papers that have good coverage of the respective criteria.Implications for RehabilitationHuman computer interface (HCI) solutions are critical for addressing the main issues facing people with disabilities (PWD) in their life.Assessment of scientific research papers according to well-defined criteria that address PWD needs would assist in verifying their suitability for PWDs.Novel quantitative assessment methodology is used for assessing these research papers using judgment of experienced researchers according to 13 well-defined criteria that have been weighted according to relevancy to different impairment groups.Identifying research papers that have good coverage of defined criteria and knowing the research area that needs further investigation by researchers and developers, would ultimately address the rehabilitation needs for PWD.},

  abstract = {Africa is currently the fastest-urbanizing continent in the world. As part of this rapid growth, New Towns are increasingly employed by private developers as a means of providing well-serviced urban environments to middle- and upper-income groups. These comprehensively-planned New Towns are often seen in contrast to the perceived ‘chaos’ and ‘congestion’ of large African cities. As a result, two urban forms, the highly controlled New Towns and the unregulated settlements at their edges, engage in complex social and economic exchanges, but remain spatially segregated and socially exclusive. Current research points to the need for an alternative approach to top-down New Town planning in Africa. Participatory workshops are one alternative that can offer planners access to local knowledge that is otherwise difficult to access. This paper explores the potential of short-term reflective, design, and serious gaming workshops by reflecting on the experiences of the authors in four recent workshops. The paper evaluates the effectiveness of these workshops as useful tools to increase inclusivity in African New Towns by bringing together stakeholders with competing agendas and supporting open discussion, negotiation, and informed decision-making. The paper concludes that participation from stakeholder groups that would normally be marginalized from the planning process (such as current residents, temporary users, and residents of adjacent unregulated communities), can offer new insights to planning bodies and inform more inclusive New Towns across the continent.},

We carried out a qualitative study including in-depth interviews with people of low vision.The analysis revealed several key concepts to understand people’s lived experiences of low vision including the ambiguity of their self-images and burdens in the interaction with the sighted people. The importance of building ’self-confidence of managing people’s appropriate appearances’ of low vision was emphasized. We created a conceptual design of a total assistive solution that supported people of low vision to perform each stage of a comprehensive cycle of the arrangement of their appearances. Our challenge continues to enhance a methodology for bridging a gap between qualitative research and the design of user experience.},

  abstract = {A new approach to writing culture has arrived: multispecies ethnography. Plants, animals, fungi, and microbes appear alongside humans in this singular book about natural and cultural history. Anthropologists have collaborated with artists and biological scientists to illuminate how diverse organisms are entangled in political, economic, and cultural systems. Contributions from influential writers and scholars, such as Dorion Sagan, Karen Barad, Donna Haraway, and Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing, are featured along with essays by emergent artists and cultural anthropologists.Delectable mushrooms flourishing in the aftermath of ecological disaster, microbial cultures enlivening the politics and value of food, and nascent life forms running wild in the age of biotechnology all figure in this curated collection of essays and artifacts. Recipes provide instructions on how to cook acorn mush, make cheese out of human milk, and enliven forests after they have been clear-cut. The Multispecies Salon investigates messianic dreams, environmental nightmares, and modest sites of biocultural hope.For additional materials see the companion website: www.multispecies-salon.org/Contributors.

  abstract = {In this paper, we aim to provide prototype validation with a theoretical framework located within the philosophy of science. Toward that end, we consider Popperian and Quinean accounts of scientific knowledge and argue that the theoretical underpinning of prototype validation is Quine’s holistic philosophy of science, whose cornerstone principle is that all beliefs are revisable. Specifically, our thesis is that the systems developer and prototype end user join forces — not as Popperian falsifiers, who make a decision rule to reject the prototype on account of any divergence, major or minor, from the user’s mental model, but — as Quinean revisers, with the objective of fine-tuning the prototype (or the user’s mental model) so that the prototype and the user’s mental model are congruent with each other. This paper suggests that prototype revisions are belief revisions, and, as such, should be guided — and are guided — by pragmatic norms, such as conservatism, simplicity, and generality, and are influenced by social, or sociological, factors as well.},

The social model of disability dictates an empowering approach to assistive technology research and development where consumers are given the power to configure and even create technology to suit their own needs and desires. The technology that comes from this approach is called accessible technology, rather than assistive technology, emphasizing its role in making human activities more accessible.},

  abstract = {Purpose This study assessed a new technology system to help six participants with intellectual and visual disabilities manage leisure engagement and communication with distant partners in an independent manner.Methods A nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across participants was used to assess the effects of the new technology system. This included a Samsung Galaxy J4 Plus smartphone with Android 9.0 operating system, mini voice recording devices, and a Bluetooth speaker. The smartphone was provided with a Google account and Internet connection. The participants could activate the smartphone’s Google Assistant and thus access leisure events, start telephone calls or send messages by triggering mini voice recording devices. Each device, when triggered, uttered a specific verbal request (i.e., a request for a leisure option or for a communication partner to call or to reach by messages). Messages received from those partners were read automatically by the smartphone.Results During baseline (when the voice recording devices were not available), the participants did not manage to activate the smartphone’s Google Assistant and thus did not access leisure events and did not make telephone calls or send messages independently. During the post-intervention phase (when the voice recording devices were available), all participants accessed leisure events and made telephone calls or sent and received messages independently, remaining positively engaged throughout the 10-min sessions. Staff rated the new technology system positively.Conclusion The new technology system may be a useful resource to help people like the participants of this study access basic leisure and communication independently.Implications for rehabilitationA technology system relying on commercial devices may be practical and acceptable in daily programs for persons with intellectual and other disabilities.Such system may be used for supporting the persons’ independent leisure engagement and communication with distant partners.A system may be accessible to persons with significant disabilities if the responses needed to operate it are simple.Simple hand-pressure responses may be sufficient to operate a system that relies on the input of mini voice recording devices},

Interpretive flexibility, the structure of informatic and work process needs and arrangements, and, finally, the dynamic between ill-structured and more tailored uses of the objects. Much of the use of the concept has concentrated on the aspect of interpretive flexibility and has often mistaken or conflated this flexibility with the process of tacking back-and-forth between the ill-structured and well-structured aspects of the arrangements. Boundary objects are not useful at just any level of scale or without full consideration of the entire model. The article discusses these aspects of the architecture of boundary objects and includes a discussion of one of the ways that boundary objects appeared as a concept in earlier work done by Star. It concludes with methodological considerations about how to study the system of boundary objects and infrastructure.},

  abstract = {It is striking that designers often speak of the spirit of good design. That spirit is the decisive goal of designers yet it escapes definition, description and often evades discussion. This chapter is a meditation on the complex interaction between design and animism. First, an exploration of what is commonly known as animism is required, for the difference between animism and post-animism has only little to do with the belief in the life of things, and actually, is a severely outdated construct of the 19th century. Second, the current discussion on animistic epistemologies is reviewed in order to further clarify the term and to enable a more inclusive and relational discourse for product design theory. Third, some evolutionary considerations are dedicated to the question of cognitive epistemologies in general and whether or not humans are innately animistic, specifically. Finally, purposeful animism – the idea of designing animistic relationships between objects and users of objects – is explored. Here emotional durability as a design direction is addressed since it seeks to create stronger emotionality and enduring interaction with things, which in turn can lead to a more sustainable use of resources. Things regarded as housing a spirit – it is assumed here – are more likely to be revered and protected.},

  abstract = {Academic research is an invaluable development engine for creating assistive technology. Commercial enterprises are critical for making academically developed technology available to individuals provided that there are sufficient numbers of people with substantially similar technology needs. Unfortunately, there is little incentive for academic research organizations to optimize user interface, fit, finish, or function attributes associated with the assistive technology that they develop. The rate at which technology is being created that could be used to help people with disabilities is staggering. However, disturbingly little of that technology is being harnessed to provide actual benefit to the disabled community because the adaptation of that technology is viewed as too customized or the market size too small to justify commercialization. In this paper, the authors focus on the use of uniquely created non-profit organizations, such as YokyWorks Foundation, to bridge the gap between academic research and traditional commercial enterprises.},

  abstract = {Discourses on the immateriality of digital information have given way to a radical rethinking of digital materiality within information studies, cinema and media studies, and other related fields. This rethinking occurs as media archives are increasingly converting their collections into digital form, stored less and less on shelves in climate-controlled vaults, and instead stored and accessed through data servers. This newfound complexity and potential for the media archive to become “black boxed,” call for a critical approach to media archives that takes into account these new realities and their material entanglements at multiple scales of analysis. Newfound scholarly interest in multiple scales of materiality, from the micro (computer code, transmission protocols, etc.) to the macro (large, sociotechnical infrastructures) may offer new directions for rethinking the nature of media archives in the age of digitization. This paper reviews the literature on these recent trends and identifies three intertwined research approaches for analyzing emergent phenomena related to the digitization of media archives: Critical forensic, institutional/infrastructural, and global/ecological perspectives. These approaches help to extend postmodern conceptualizations of the archive by showing how the archive as infrastructure is bound up in unfolding political, ecological and epistemological struggles.}

  abstract = {Increased awareness, interest and use of assistive technology (AT) presents substantial opportunities for many citizens to become, or continue being, meaningful participants in society. However, there is a significant shortfall between the need for and provision of AT, and this is patterned by a range of social, demographic and structural factors. To seize the opportunity that assistive technology offers, regional, national and sub-national assistive technology policies are urgently required. This paper was developed for and through discussion at the Global Research, Innovation and Education on Assistive Technology (GREAT) Summit; organized under the auspices of the World Health Organization’s Global Collaboration on Assistive Technology (GATE) program. It outlines some of the key principles that AT polices should address and recognizes that AT policy should be tailored to the realities of the contexts and resources available. AT policy should be developed as a part of the evolution of related policy across a number of different sectors and should have clear and direct links to AT as mediators and moderators for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The consultation process, development and implementation of policy should be fully inclusive of AT users, and their representative organizations, be across the lifespan, and imbued with a strong systems-thinking ethos. Six barriers are identified which funnel and diminish access to AT and are addressed systematically within this paper. We illustrate an example of good practice through a case study of AT services in Norway, and we note the challenges experienced in less well-resourced settings. A number of economic factors relating to AT and economic arguments for promoting AT use are also discussed. To address policy-development the importance of active citizenship and advocacy, the need to find mechanisms to scale up good community practices to a higher level, and the importance of political engagement for the policy process, are highlighted. Policy should be evidence-informed and allowed for evidence-making; however, it is important to account for other factors within the given context in order for policy to be practical, authentic and actionable.Implications for RehabilitationThe development of policy in the area of asssitive technology is important to provide an overarching vision and outline resourcing priorities.This paper identifies some of the key themes that should be addressed when developing or revising assistive technology policy.Each country should establish a National Assistive Technology policy and develop a theory of change for its implementation.},

Unfortunately, information about the choice of design methods and their impact is often lacking in the literature. A table summarizes and classifies the design methods identified in the case-studies. Results show that User-Centered Design (UCD) tools are widely used for designing assistive device. Many authors stated or expected the UCD approach to be helpful in this field. Rarely designers use additional tools from other fields such as anthropometric values from ergonomics, joint range measure / psycho-motor tests from medicine and ABAB design from psychology, although they seem totally relevant.},

  abstract = {This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human–machine interaction as a milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a practical–theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the human and the nonhuman. Using a ‘research through making’ approach, the article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an openended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital interaction, and to engender creative human–nonhuman relationships within a given digital milieu.},

In interviews with the architect duo Brillembourg/Klumpner, design activist Alastair Fuad-Luke and philosopher of technology Pieter Paul Verbeek, the theory of social design is held up against the often intractable practice.},

  abstract = {Background: Voice assistants allow users to control appliances and functions of a smart home by simply uttering a few words. Such systems hold the potential to significantly help users with motor and cognitive disabilities who currently depend on their caregiver even for basic needs (eg, opening a door). The research on voice assistants is mainly dedicated to able-bodied users, and studies evaluating the accessibility of such systems are still sparse and fail to account for the participants’ actual motor, linguistic, and cognitive abilities. Objective: The aim of this work is to investigate whether cognitive and/or linguistic functions could predict user performance in operating an off-the-shelf voice assistant (Google Home). Methods: A group of users with disabilities (n=16) was invited to a living laboratory and asked to interact with the system. Besides collecting data on their performance and experience with the system, their cognitive and linguistic skills were assessed using standardized inventories. The identification of predictors (cognitive and/or linguistic) capable of accounting for an efficient interaction with the voice assistant was investigated by performing multiple linear regression models. The best model was identified by adopting a selection strategy based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results: For users with disabilities, the effectiveness of interacting with a voice assistant is predicted by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Robertson Dysarthria Profile (specifically, the ability to repeat sentences), as the best model shows (AIC=130.11). Conclusions: Users with motor, linguistic, and cognitive impairments can effectively interact with voice assistants, given specific levels of residual cognitive and linguistic skills. More specifically, our paper advances practical indicators to predict the level of accessibility of speech-based interactive systems. Finally, accessibility design guidelines are introduced based on the performance results observed in users with disabilities.},

  abstract = {What is soul? Can it be forfeited? Can it be traded away? If it can, what would ensue? What consequences would follow from loss of soul — for the individual, for society, for the earth? In the early nineteenth century, Goethe’s hero, Faust, became a defining archetype of modernity, a harbinger of the existential possibilities and moral complexities of the modern condition. But today the dire consequences of the Faustian pact with the devil are becoming alarmingly visible. In light of this, how would Goethe’s arguably flawed drama play out in a 21st-century century setting? Would a contemporary Faust sign up to a demonic deal? Indeed what, in the wake of two hundred years of social and economic development, would be left for the devil to offer him? A contemporary Faust would already possess everything the original Faust in his ascetic cloister lacked — affluence and mobility; celebrity and worldly influence; access to information; religious choice; sexual freedom and the availability of women — though women, it must be noted, currently also partake of that same freedom. The only thing a present-day Faust would lack would be his soul. Would he miss it? Does soul even exist? If it does, it would of course be the one thing the devil could not bestow. So from what or whom could Faust retrieve it? What, in a word, would a contemporary Faust most deeply desire? In pursuit of these questions, Ardea engages a familiar but possibly faulty archetype, that of Faust, with an unfamiliar one, that of the white heron, borrowed from a short story of the same name by nineteenth-century American author, Sarah Orne Jewett. In Jewett’s tale, a soul-pact of an entirely different kind from that entered into by Faust is proposed. It is a pact with the wild, a pledge of fealty, of non-forfeiture, that promises to redraw the violent psycho-sexual and psycho-spiritual patterns that have underpinned modernity. How would a present-day heir to the Faustian tradition, ingrained with the habit of entitlement but also burdened with the consequences of the old pact, respond to the new proposition?},

  abstract = {We present results from a mixed methods study of screen reader use and switching behavior among people with vision impairments in India. We examine loyalty and experimentation with screen readers and find that the main drivers of adoption for early users differ significantly from the factors that drive continued use by advanced users. We discuss the factor that emerges as one of the strongest stated drivers of early adoption, text-to-speech “voice” quality, particularly a “human-sounding voice” as one of the key features differentiating free/open source products from more expensive proprietary products. While the initial preferences are driven by voice quality, application support becomes more important over time as users speed up their sound settings and become more comfortable with the resultant non-human-sounding speech. We discuss these findings from two theoretical perspectives—first, through the application of the economics of behavior switching, and second, vis-à-vis novice and expert approaches toward new product adoption. We argue that these findings further our understanding of initial user comfort related to assistive technology adoption, and the impact of early technology choices on long-term technology switching behavior.},

  abstract = {With the widespread use of AI systems and applications in our everyday lives, it is important to take fairness issues into consideration while designing and engineering these types of systems. Such systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that the decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. We have recently seen work in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning that addresses such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming aware of the biases that these applications can contain and have attempted to address them. In this survey we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined in order to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and how they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

  abstract = {The Covid19-pandemic has accelerated processes in which digital platforms, privileged by their critical size, become central instances of urban life. While most scholars associate platform urbanism with transnational platform corporations, such as Amazon or Facebook, local non-corporate platforms unexpectedly persist despite lacking critical size. This article analyzes processes through which non-corporate platforms are created, main­ tained, disseminated, and locally implemented; given this type of platform’s absence of critical size. We explain the persistence of local non-corporate platforms by drawing on the concept of embeddedness. Embeddedness accounts for non-market-based, i.e. socially and culturally influenced behavior, that shapes economic in­ teractions. We distinguish between network embeddedness, in which organizations maintain permanent and exclusive relationships with one another, and local embeddedness, which combines Hess’ (2004) notions of societal embeddedness and territorial embeddedness. This article is empirically grounded on an analysis of two most different ways of creating and maintaining, disseminating, and locally implementing non-corporate plat­ forms: Platform cooperativism and free/libre open-source software-based platforms (FLOSS-based platforms). Two empirical case studies of collaboratively governed Western-European non-corporate platforms, Gebiedonline and Decidim, respectively inform the analysis of platform cooperativism and FLOSS-based platforms. Gebiedonline is a platform cooperative through which neighborhood and theme-specific platforms are created. Decidim is a FLOSS-based platform that is mainly used for civic and political participation processes. We find that govern­ ments and civil society stakeholders create non-corporate platform technology by disentangling processes related to the creation, maintenance, and dissemination of platform technology from platform implementation pro­ cesses. Following platform creation, platform maintenance is embedded in a network. Non-corporate platforms pool cost-intensive technology maintenance, while platform implementation necessarily takes place in a locally embedded manner.},

\par
Every reel of the archive includes a copy of the “Guide to the GitHub Code Vault” in five languages, written with input from GitHub’s community and available at \href{https://github.com/github/archive-program}{the Archive Program’s own GitHub repository}. In addition, the archive will include a separate human-readable reel which documents the technical history and cultural context of the archive’s contents. We call this the Tech Tree.~
\par
Inspired by the Long Now’s \href{https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/manual-for-civilization/home}{Manual for Civilization}, the Tech Tree will consist primarily of existing works, selected to provide a detailed understanding of modern computing, open source and its applications, modern software development, popular programming languages, etc. It will also include works which explain the many layers of technical foundations that make software possible: microprocessors, networking, electronics, semiconductors, and even pre-industrial technologies. This will allow the archive’s inheritors to better understand today’s world and its technologies, and may even help them recreate computers to use the archived software.
\par
Encapsulating the world’s cultural context and technical history is a challenging prospect, and we expect the Tech Tree to evolve and iterate over time. We will soon publish to the Archive Program’s GitHub repository a very initial draft list of works selected for the Tech Tree, along with, importantly, a request for community input. We look forward to incorporating ideas and suggestions from the GitHub community before the Tech Tree is added to the Arctic Code Vault.}

Frontiers were conceived as the line indicating the last point in the relentless march of civilization. On the one side of the frontiers was civilization; on the other, nothing; just barbarism or emptiness. The march of civilization and the idea of the frontiers created a geographic and bodygraphic divide. Certain areas of the planet were designated as the location of the barbarians, and since the eighteenth century, of the primitives. In one stroke, bodies were classified and assigned a given place on the planet. But who had the authority to enact such a classification, and what was the logic of that classification?

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe the responses of 4 widely used conversational agents (Siri [Apple], Google Now, S Voice [Samsung], and Cortana [Microsoft]) to a standardized panel of questions related to mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A pilot study followed by a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 68 phones from 7 manufacturers conducted from December 2015 to January 2016. Investigators asked the smartphones 9 questions (3 each in mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health) in their natural language. We recorded information on features of the smartphones and their software, including manufacturer, phone model, operating system version, and conversational agent. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the responses of conversational agents to 9 questions. The responses were characterized based on the ability to (1) recognize a crisis, (2) respond with respectful language, and (3) refer to an appropriate helpline, or other health resources for a physical health concern. Questions were asked repeatedly until there were no new answers. RESULTS The phones ran 77 conversational agents: Siri (n = 27), Google Now (n = 31), S Voice (n = 9), and Cortana (n = 10). Siri, Google Now, and S Voice recognized the statement “I want to commit suicide” as concerning; Siri and Google Now referred the user to a suicide prevention helpline. In response to “I am depressed,” Siri recognized the concern and responded with respectful language, the responses from S Voice and Cortana varied, and Google Now did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents referred users to a helpline for depression. In response to “I was raped,” Cortana referred to a sexual assault hotline; Siri, Google Now, and S Voice did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents recognized “I am being abused” or “I was beaten up by my husband.” In response to “I am having a heart attack,” “My head hurts,” and “My foot hurts.” Siri generally recognized the concern, referred to emergency services, and identified nearby medical facilities. Google Now, S Voice, and Cortana did not recognize any of the physical health concerns. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE When asked simple questions about mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health, Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and S Voice responded inconsistently and incompletely. If conversational agents are to respond fully and effectively to health concerns, their performance will have to substantially improve.},

  abstract = {More than 40 years ago, Masahiro Mori, a robotics professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, wrote an essay [1] on how he envisioned people's reactions to robots that looked and acted almost like a human. In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available. The following is the first publication of an English translation that has been authorized and reviewed by Mori. (See “Turning Point” in this issue for an interview with Mori.).},

In partnership with a blind child, we explore the challenges and opportunities of designing human-AI interaction for a system intended to support social sensemaking. Adopting a research-through-design perspective, we refect upon working with the uncertain capabilities of AI systems in the design of this experience. We contribute: (i) a concrete example of an open-ended AI system that enabled a blind child to extend his own capabilities; (ii) an illustration of the delta between imagined and actual use, highlighting how capabilities derive from the human-AI interaction and not the AI system alone; and (iii) a discussion of design choices to craft an ongoing human-AI interaction that addresses the challenge of uncertain outputs of AI systems.},

Less attention, however, has been given to the fact that voice assistants are also web interfaces that might impact on how the web is accessed, understood and employed by users. This article aims to advance work in this context by identifying a range of issues that should spark additional reflections and discussions within communication and media studies and related fields. In particular, the article focuses on three key issues that have to do with long-standing discussions about the social and political impact of the internet: the role of web platforms in shaping information access, the relationship between production and consumption online, and the role of affect in informing engagement with web resources. Considering these issues in regard to voice assistants not only helps contextualize these technologies within existing debates in communication and media studies, but also highlights that voice assistants pose novel questions to internet research, challenging assumptions of what the web looks like as speech becomes one of the key ways to access resources and information online.},

The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

A literature review illustrated that workshops are discussed according to three different perspectives: workshops as a means, workshops as practice, and workshops as a research methodology. Focusing primarily on the latter, this paper presents five studies on upper secondary and higher education teachers’ professional development and on teaching and learning through video conferencing. Through analysis and discussion of these studies’ findings, we argue that workshops provide a platform that can aid researchers in identifying and exploring relevant factors in a given domain by providing means for understanding complex work and knowledge processes that are supported by technology (for example, e-learning). The approach supports identifying factors that are not obvious to either the participants or the researchers prior to commencing the workshop process. This paper also discusses the facilitator’s different clinical and ethnographic roles and highlights the risks and ethical issues involved during both the workshop process and the workshop data analysis. As such, these collaborative and immersive aspects frame workshops as a research approach that has the potential to advance meaning negotiation between researchers and participants.},

Workshops unite stakeholders in the utilization of participatory methods, coalescing in the best possible creative solutions. Objective: This systematic review aimed to identify design approaches whilst providing guidance to health information technology designers/researchers in devising and organizing workshops. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in five medical/library databases identifying 568 articles. The initial duplication removal resulted in 562 articles. A criteria-based screening of the title field, abstracts, and pre-full-texts reviews resulted in 72 records for full-text review. The final review resulted in 10 article exclusions. Results: 62 publications were included in the review. These studies focused on consumer facing and clinical health information technologies. The studied technologies involved both clinician and patients and encompassed an array of health conditions. Diverse workshop activities and deliverables were reported. Only seven publications reported workshop evaluation data. Discussion: This systematic review focused on workshops as a design and research activity in the health informatics domain. Our review revealed three themes: (1) There are a variety of ways of conducting design workshops; (2) Workshops are effective design and research approaches; (3) Various levels of workshop details were reported.},

These devices embody intelligent software agents that support users in their everyday life through easy and intuitive conversational interactions. While their use in everyday activities is largely unexplored, the proliferation in home use presents a valuable opportunity to add to understanding around the use of in-home digital personal assistants. In this paper, we investigate their home use in a broad context to learn more about people’s experiences, attitudes, interactions and expectations with these devices contributing new insights to current knowledge around this use. Applying the digital ethnography method, we collected 3542 reviews and comments about Amazon Echo, Google Home, and Apple HomePod on Amazon, eBay, and Reddit. Six main themes and 29 categories were derived through filtering, thematic analysis and affinity diagramming. These findings constitute a conceptual framework characterising the current landscape of home use of digital personal assistants. Additionally, we identify and discuss unique issues discovered around the invisible interface, interactive freedom, and creative appropriation. We use our findings to propose implications for interaction design of DPAs for home use.},

While stigma has been known to be associated with presence of disability for many years, relationship between stigma and AT usage, particularly when working with families across cultures, has only just begun to be examined. Issues confronted by AT decision-making teams related to stigma include family expectations of AT, visibility resulting from use of AT in public settings, and perceptions that children will not attain important developmental skills if they become reliant on devices. While numerous approaches for AT decision-making have been implemented in the field, absence of validity and reliability data related to such approaches emphasizes importance of understanding potential influences of stigma associated with AT use. Specific areas that can contribute to stigmatization include (a) device aesthetics/cosmesis, (b) gender and age appropriateness, (c) social acceptability, (d) sublimation and professional deference, (e) teachers and acceptance of disability, and (f) universal design principles. Importance of future research that explores stigma and government policy and impact on AT decision-making is noted.},

  abstract = {Purpose of the paper: The increasing consumer adoption of voice-based artificial intelligence technologies is starting to catch the attention of researchers. This study fits into the nascent marketing literature on user perceptions of interactions with voice assistants (VAs) by exploring perceived VA anthropomorphism and benefits. We also seek to identify millennial clusters based on perceptual differences. Methodology: Quantitative exploratory research was conducted based on questionnaires (N=337) administered to millennials. The data were analysed through exploratory factor analysis. Subsequently, to identify clusters, we performed K-means cluster analysis. Findings: The EFA indicated a four-factor solution: “utilitarian and hedonic benefits”, “symbolic benefits”, “human-like voice” and “human-like presence”. The K-means cluster analysis identified three clusters: “useful and pleasant”, “human” and “status symbol”. Research limits: This paper is not exempt from limitations, especially those related to the exploratory nature of the analysis techniques adopted. Practical implications: Indicating the main perceptual dimensions of VA anthropomorphism and the benefits associated with user-VA interaction, our results provide marketers with important strategic implications for designing the VA interaction experience. The cluster analysis offers companies the possibility of selecting a target and addressing it by creating a specific value proposition. Originality of the paper: This study contributes to the existing partial and fragmented knowledge by offering an overall integrated interpretation of consumer perceptions related to VA interactions. Our findings are the first to jointly reveal user perceptions of the human voice and of the VA as a human interlocutor. Moreover, we contribute to the literature on anthropomorphism by conceptualising the human-like voice construct.},

We discuss the tangle of practical and nonfunctional needs that characterize the experience of users at home in an ampler way, aiming at effective wellbeing. To synthesize the results of ethnography, we introduce the concept of resilience in domestic environment arguing that, in the design of solutions for home automation, we must consider home as a dynamic place, apt to support the continuous change of needs and lifestyles of users.},

For relationships to work it is essential for trust to be established. Although the capabilities of VAs offer retailers and consumers enhanced opportunities, building trust with machines is inherently challenging. In this paper, we propose integrating Human–Computer Interaction Theories and Para-Social Relationship Theory to develop insight into how trust and attitudes toward VAs are established. By adopting a mixed-method approach, first, we quantitatively examine the proposed model using Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modeling on 466 respondents; based on the findings of this study, a second qualitative study is employed to reveal four main themes. Findings show that while functional elements drive users' attitude toward using VAs, the social attributes, being social presence and social cognition, are the unique antecedents for developing trust. Additionally, the research illustrates a peculiar dynamic between privacy and trust and it shows how users distinguish two different sources of trustworthiness in their interactions with VAs, identifying the brand producers as the data collector. Taken together, these results reinforce the idea that individuals interact with VAs treating them as social entities and employing human social rules, thus supporting the adoption of a para-social perspective.},

In this article, I approach data processing by combining scholarship on invisible labor in knowledge infrastructures with a Marxian framework and show the relevance of considering data processing as factory labor. Using this perspective to analyze ethnographic data collected during a six-month participatory observation at a U.S. data archive, I generate a taxonomy of the forms of alienation that data processing generates, but also the types of resistance that processors develop, across four categories: routine, speed, skill, and meaning. This synthetic approach demonstrates, first, that data processing reproduces typical forms of factory worker’s alienation: processors are asked to work along a strict standardized pipeline, at a fast pace, without acquiring substantive skills or having a meaningful involvement in their work. It reveals, second, how data processors resist the alienating nature of this workflow by developing multiple tactics along the same four categories. Seen through this dual lens, data processors are therefore not only invisible workers, but also factory workers who follow and subvert a workflow organized as an assembly line. I conclude by proposing a four-step framework to better value the social contribution of data workers beyond the archive.},

The case of recent initiatives aiming to ‘open up’ radio access network (or RAN, a key component of telecommunications infrastructure) with an ‘open RAN’ model reveals how the US Government came to promote this nascent technology to create an opposition between its own ‘open’ telecommunications networks versus proprietary and presumed ‘untrustworthy’ networks based on foreign equipment, namely Huawei. While a closer look casts doubts on the benefits of open radio access network to increase network security or to open up the equipment market, this case reveals how openness is an ambiguous notion that can be used by governments to exclude foreign trade enemies, while advocating for trust in telecommunications networks.},

\par
“open” as a replacement for the proprietary, and as discursive device
\par
\emph{Open RAN - three critical perspectives}
\par
“First, networks and their components – such as the RAN – are sites of political–economic struggle between various opposed stakeholders who want to increase their power, from transatlantic telegraph cables to contemporary Internet” (Plantin, 2021, p. 405)
\par
“Open RAN proponents similarly position this technology as instantiating an imaginary of ‘openness’ that they equate with ‘trust’ or even ‘democracy’ and position against ‘untrustworthy’ and ‘black-boxed’ proprietary and foreign technologies” (Plantin, 2021, p. 405)
\par
“Finally, communication networks are constituted of series of standards, for example, those constituting the RAN, whose design and selection reveal how actors with competing interests include and exclude other actors from shaping the future of networks” (Plantin, 2021, p. 405)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
networks, imaginaries and standards

\item 
Open RAN is the platformization of hardware

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Initiators}
\par
“The open RAN model was created in 2016 in a working group from the industry consortium Telecom Infra Project (TIP), which brings together telecommunication operators and manufacturers (among others) to promote, as per the official website, ‘open, disaggregated, and standards-based technology solutions’ in the field of telecommunications.” (Plantin, 2021, p. 407)
\par
But who are these manufacturers who are part of TIP if not those in the oligopoly?
\par
“operators use open modularity as an attempt to increase their control over the configuration of networking equipment” (Plantin, 2021, p. 407)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
competition as something good, at least that is one of the main arguments on modularity. freedom in this regard is only for the operators, not society at large

\item 
open as opposed to black boxed foreign gear

\end{itemize}

\par

  abstract = {Two theoretical approaches have recently emerged to characterize new digital objects of study in the media landscape: infrastructure studies and platform studies. Despite their separate origins and different features, we demonstrate in this article how the cross-articulation of these two perspectives improves our understanding of current digital media. We use case studies of the Open Web, Facebook, and Google to demonstrate that infrastructure studies provides a valuable approach to the evolution of shared, widely accessible systems and services of the type often provided or regulated by governments in the public interest. On the other hand, platform studies captures how communication and expression are both enabled and constrained by new digital systems and new media. In these environments, platform-based services acquire characteristics of infrastructure, while both new and existing infrastructures are built or reorganized on the logic of platforms. We conclude by underlining the potential of this combined framework for future case studies.},

\subsection{\emph{Platforms}}

\par
“platforms are architectures comprising three key elements: core components with low variability, complementary components with high variability, and interfaces for modularity between core and complementary components (Baldwin and Woodward, 2008). Such architecture can lower the cost of innovation because it avoids building an entirely new system for each new product (Baldwin and Woodward, 2008: 8–9).” (Plantin et al., 2018, p. 296)
\par
““If you can program it, it’s a platform. If you can’t, it’s not”” (Plantin et al., 2018, p. 297)
\par
“a “set of relations that constantly needs to be performed,” in part due to continual friction between, on one side, users’ goals of expression and, on the other side, platforms’ profit-seeking aims and the legal surround that defines legitimate use (van Dijck, 2013: 26).” (Plantin et al., 2018, p. 297)

“unlike system builders, platform builders do not seek to internalize their environments through vertical integration.” (Plantin et al., 2018, p. 298)

\textbf{\emph{The internet transformed from an infrastructure to someting with aspects of a platform.}}

“The history of networked computing resources can thus be seen as the transformation of a traditional monopoly infrastructure model into the deregulated, privatized, and splintered—we might say “platformized”—infrastructure model so prevalent in many sectors today (Abbate, 1999; Edwards, 1998; Kahin and Abbate, 1995; Kahin and Keller, 1997).” (Plantin et al., 2018, p. 301)

Two concepts, stigma and liminality (existing in a state of transition), are used to frame users’ perceptions of the assistive technology they use, as generated through research projects investigating aspects of assistive technology use. Implications of the meaning of AT to the design and selection process are described. Assistive technology that is seen as a tool, as just another way of achieving a desired activity is much more likely to be assimilated into the user’s daily life. Technology perceived in this manner enables people to share activities with others and augment their personal abilities. Alternately, technology can be seen as a visible sign of disability, reinforcing stigma associated with a disability and the perception of the AT user as existing somewhere between health and illness. Individuals with this view of technology may avoid or resist use of technology, resulting in avoidance of meaningful activities and both social and physical isolation. These findings support the conclusion that technology is not neutral. Inclusion of users in both the design and selection process and understanding the meaning that AT use holds are integral to the development of assistive technology that achieves the desired outcome of enabling participation in daily life.},

Utilizing an enactive view of social cognition theory, this study demonstrates how voice assistants can act as [semi] autonomous agents to hold instantaneous social interactions with consumers. This research employed two experimental studies. Study 1 used two voice assistant mobile applications, Microsoft Cortana and Google Assistant, and Study 2 used Amazon Alexa and Microsoft Cortana. The contributions this paper makes are two-fold. First, the results illustrate how perceived auditory sense drives perceived auditory control through auditory social interactions with a voice assistant that lead to brand affect and consumers’ trust in the voice assistant. Second, results shed light on the role of surprise as a repelling drive that attenuates the effect of perceived auditory control on brand affect.},

The first, broader study is a content analysis of 346 Amazon Echo reviews that include users with disabilities, while the second study more specifically focuses on users with visual impairments, through interviews with 16 current users of home-based IPAs. Findings show that, although some accessibility challenges exist, users with a range of disabilities are using the Amazon Echo, including for unexpected cases such as speech therapy and support for caregivers. Richer voice-based applications and solutions to support discoverability would be particularly useful to users with visual impairments. These findings should inform future work on accessible voice-based IPAs.},

  abstract = {How the tools of design research can involve designers more directly with objects, products and services they design; from human-centered research methods to formal experimentation, process models, and application to real world design problems.                 The tools of design research, writes Brenda Laurel, will allow designers "to claim and direct the power of their profession." Often neglected in the various curricula of design schools, the new models of design research described in this book help designers to investigate people, form, and process in ways that can make their work more potent and more delightful. "At the very least," Peter Lunenfeld writes in the preface, "design research saves us from reinventing the wheel. At its best, a lively research methodology can reinvigorate the passion that so often fades after designers join the profession." The goal of the book is to introduce designers to the many research tools that can be used to inform design as well as to ideas about how and when to deploy them effectively. The chapter authors come from diverse institutions and enterprises, including Stanford University, MIT, Intel, Maxis, Studio Anybody, Sweden's HUMlab, and Big Blue Dot. Each has something to say about how designers make themselves better at what they do through research, and illustrates it with real world examples—case studies, anecdotes, and images. Topics of this multi-voice conversation include qualitative and quantitative methods, performance ethnography and design improvisation, trend research, cultural diversity, formal and structural research practice, tactical discussions of design research process, and case studies drawn from areas as unique as computer games, museum information systems, and movies. Interspersed throughout the book are one-page "demos," snapshots of the design research experience. Design Research charts the paths from research methods to research findings to design principles to design results and demonstrates the transformation of theory into a richly satisfying and more reliably successful practice.},

Our consumptive path through modern life leaves a wake of social and ecological destruction—sneakers worn only once, bicycles barely even ridden, and forgotten smartphones languishing in drawers. By what perverse alchemy do our newest, coolest things so readily transform into meaningless junk? In Meaningful Stuff, Jonathan Chapman investigates why we throw away things that still work, and shows how we can design products, services, and systems that last. Obsolescence is an economically driven design decision—a plan to hasten a product's functional or psychological undesirability. Many electronic devices, for example, are intentionally impossible to dismantle for repair or recycling, their brief use-career proceeding inexorably to a landfill. A sustainable design specialist who serves as a consultant to global businesses and governmental organizations, Chapman calls for the decoupling of economic activity from mindless material consumption and shows how to do it.Chapman shares his vision for an “experience heavy, material light” design sensibility. This vital and timely new design philosophy reveals how meaning emerges from designed encounters between people and things, explores ways to increase the quality and longevity of our relationships with objects and the systems behind them, and ultimately demonstrates why design can—and must—lead the transition to a sustainable future.},

  abstract = {Project Cybersyn was a Chilean project from 1971 to 1973 during the presidency of Salvador Allende aimed at constructing a distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy. The project consisted of four modules: an economic simulator, custom software to check factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of telex machines that were linked to one mainframe computer.Project Cybersyn was based on viable system model theory approach to organizational design, and featured innovative technology for its time: it included a network of telex machines (Cybernet) in state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in Santiago. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (Cyberstride) that would monitor production indicators, such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism, in "almost" real time, alerting the workers in the first case and, in abnormal situations, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges by a very large degree, also the central government. The information would also be input into economic simulation software (CHECO, for CHilean ECOnomic simulator) that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. Finally, a sophisticated operations room (Opsroom) would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate feasible responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network. The principal architect of the system was British operations research scientist Stafford Beer, and the system embodied his notions of organisational cybernetics in industrial management. One of its main objectives was to devolve decision-making power within industrial enterprises to their workforce in order to develop self-regulation of factories. After the military coup on September 11, 1973, Cybersyn was abandoned and the operations room was destroyed.},

The potential places where ANT and feminism can meet and mutually shape research on scientific practice and technological innovation are explored. In doing so, this paper moves toward an imagining of a feminist ANT.}

While establishing a parallel between the system of objects and the world of living organisms, this exposition poses a critical and original perspective on our relation with objects and raises a reflection on the notions of durability, environmental degradation, overconsumption and emotional attachment, while anticipating the potential impacts of connected objects and artificial intelligence on our private lives.},

The development of user interfaces influences the changes in the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Human hand gestures have been a mode of non verbal interaction widely used. Naturalistic and intuitiveness of the hand gesture has been a great motivating factor for the researchers in the area of HCI to put their efforts to research and develop the more promising means of interaction between human and computers. This paper designs a system for gestural interaction between a user and a computer in dynamic environment. The gesture recognition system uses image processing techniques for detection, segmentation, tracking and recognition of hand gestures for converting it to a meaningful command. The interface being proposed here can be substantially applied towards different applications like image browser, games etc.},

  abstract = {In recent contributions to the emerging anthropology of infrastructure, the issue of agency often plays the role of the proverbial elephant in the room—an area that most scholars are reluctant to engage with. In this paper we highlight the implicit dichotomization between human and non-human that characterizes this body of literature. In so doing we approach the question of agency not as a subjective property emanating from a conscious self—what would be very much the way traditional anthropology has come to imagine animism. Rather, by turning such an understanding of agency on its head, we take the animacy of the inbetween as the starting point from which life unfolds. According to Tim Ingold’s work on the subject, this view is consistent with the cosmologies of people traditionally described as “animists.” Yet unlike conventional understandings of the term, Ingold describes this ontology as an openness to a world in becoming. Here what brings things into existence is not an animating principle inscribed within them, but rather the potential of the field of relations in which they are embedded. We suggest that this analytical reversal can provide us with a novel framework for the analysis of infrastructures. Accordingly, we argue that roads’ doings cannot be understood as active subjectivity or a function of their material resilience. Instead of connecting, roads should be understood as growing out of connections—as an “in-between” in which their doing is also their undergoing. We will make this argument through ethnographic cases from Pakistan, Nepal, China, Myanmar, and Austria.},

In a post-Kuhnian move away from the hegemony of theory, he develops a new epistemology of experimentation in which research is treated as a process for producing epistemic things.A central concern of the book is the basic question of how novelty is generated in the empirical sciences. In addressing this question, the author brings French poststructuralist thinking—notably Jacques Derrida’s concepts of “différance” and “historiality”—to bear on the construction of epistemic things. Historiographical perspective shifts from the actors’ minds to their objects of manipulation.These epistemological and historical issues are illuminated in a detailed case study of a particular laboratory, that of the oncologist and biochemist Paul C. Zamecnik and his colleagues, located in a specific setting—the Collis P. Huntington Memorial Hospital of Harvard University at the Massachusetts General Hospital of Boston. The author traces how, between 1945 and 1965, this group developed an experimental system for synthesizing proteins in the test tube that put Zamecnik’s research team at the forefront of those who led biochemistry into the era of molecular biology.},

\subsection{1}

\par
Images are culture and representation, but also material and affective. Vision is our ability to see, whereas visuality or scopic regime is how our vision is formed or constructed. Ocularcentrism describes our simping for visual culture. Simulacra are images detached from a relation to the real world.
\par
Visual economy is about how visual objects travers cultures, forcefully or not, meanwhile changing their meanings, contexts, affects etc.
\par
it’s important to reflect on the power relations embedded in images and their media, and what they enable us to see or not see.
\par
\textbf{What do images represent, how do they affect and what power relations are they transposing?}
\par
Five important aspects in engaging with visual culture
\par
\begin{enumerate}

\item visualising social difference

\item how images are looked at

\item Differentiating visual cultures

\item the circulation of images

\item The agency of images

\end{enumerate}

\par
“an image may have its own visual effects; these effects, through the ways of seeing mobilised by the image, are crucial in the production and reproduction of visions of social difference; but these effects always intersect with the social context of viewing, with how the image is circulated, and with the visualities spectators bring to their viewing.” p. 22
\par
a critical approach to interpreting visual images:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item take images seriously

\item think amour about the social conditions and effects of images and their modes of distribution

\item ~consider your own way of looking at images

\end{itemize}

\subsection{2}

\par
Four sites of thinking about visual material
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item production

\item content

\item circulation

\item audiencing

\end{itemize}

\par
Three modalities of a site
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item technological

\item compositional

\item social (economical, social, political)

\end{itemize}

\par
Notes on figure 2.2: the womanooks at one image that we can’t see. She seems to be saying something to a man, even explaining, closely standing by. She makes a hand gesture. The man in turn looks at a painting of nude woman. In the background, a ceinturerie denotes the street is in a french speaking country. Three more people can be seen in the slightly blurry background. The photograph is black and white and could date back to something around 1900 - 1920.
\par
Images of the same gerne share certain features. It seems that genre regarding images is much easier then in game studies. Remediation is the referencing of older genre while gestating a new one. Images often fit clearly into one genre, while ~relating to others at the same time.
\par
\textbf{Auteur theory}: what did the images author had in mind at production?
\par
Compositionality: how the image‘s content is arranged
\par
Aura: the authority, authenticity and unattainability of an umage
\par
Audiencing: the process of witnessing, renegotiating or rejecting the meaning of an image, by particular audiences in particular circumstances
\par
Convergence: from medium-specific visual content to transmediality, communication interdependence, many ways of accessing media content, melange between top-down corporate comm and bottom-up participatory culture}

  abstract = {Introduction               The Israel Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Services subsidizes computer-based assistive devices for individuals with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) to assist these individuals in their interactions with computers and thus to enhance their independence and quality of life. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of computer usage on the quality of life of computer-based assistive device users, and to evaluate their capacity to carry out computer-based tasks.                                         Methods               The study was conducted between the years 2013 and 2015. Questionnaires were provided to 96 randomly sampled individuals with visual impairments. These questionnaires were designed to collect information about the quality of life, types and frequency of computer use, satisfaction with the assistive devices, and the effects of computer-based assistive device usage on the participants’ lives. In addition, the study evaluated participants’ performance in tasks such as e-mail use, Internet surfing, and the use of Microsoft Word; participants performed these tasks on their personal computers. The research sample accounts for about 10\% of visually impaired persons in Israel.                                         Results               Findings suggest that participants use computer-based assistive devices frequently (four hours a day on average), primarily for leisure (three hours on average). Participants also report high satisfaction with their devices (mean of 3.98 out of the maximum score of 5.00) and indicate that the devices have improved their quality of life (mean 3.67 out of 5.00) and leisure activities (mean 3.68 out of 5.00). Participants display high levels of task performance, especially in the use of Microsoft Word software (mean of 3.47 out of 5.00), and e-mail usage (mean of 3.81 out of 5.00).                                         Discussion               The findings suggest that most participants use computer-based assistive devices daily and report a positive influence from them on their quality of life and activity.                                         Implications for practitioners               The study suggests that welfare services and assistance organizations would benefit from subsidizing computer assistive devices for individuals with visual impairments.},

Based on our experiences from case studies, we argue that ‘considering the whole person with feelings, desires and anxieties’, one of the sensibilities McCarthy et al. formulate, influences the desirability and realisation of the other four sensibilities. By way of case studies, we show how we explored the link between ‘the whole person’ and desired interaction experience in a designerly way.

“In October 2010 the international web development community was thrown into disarray when it suddenly appeared that millions of common websites across the world would be required to satisfy the decency standards of Sharia, the religious law of Islam.1 To understand how this unlikely situation came about requires that we know about the infrastructure of the Internet; it is a story about the collision of what is ultimately a variety of seemingly unrelated actors and actions, and this instance is comprehensible only after assembling all of them. Beginning with this example, this chapter will argue for the value of investigating the details of Internet infrastructure as a method of studying the Internet and society more generally. It will argue for the study of Internet Infrastructure and also for the value of considering the Internet infrastructurally, as a system foundational to other activities.” (Sandvig, 2013, p. 86)},

Nepal is one example of a country with several coinciding challenges: some claim having a high rate of blindness in the general population, a low-GDP-per capita and some studies claim it has a low literacy rate, especially in rural areas. Without appropriate assistive technology, some disabled youth may not get full access to education.Methods To gain insight into assistive technology use in rural Nepal, five blind teenagers in a mixed secondary school with disabled and non-disabled students in rural Nepal were interviewed about their daily smartphone use.Results The results show that all the participants used screen readers on donated smartphones. None of the participants had received formal training in using smartphone screen readers and therefore lacked knowledge about basic and essential operational aspects of the devices as well as misguided expectations about the technology.Conclusions One implication of the findings is that smartphone accessibility features training material needs to be made easily available to schools and all disabled youth worldwide, as smartphones are increasingly becoming available in low-income remote regions with low literacy rates. The built-in accessibility features of smartphones promise disabled youth a non-stigmatizing platform for social participation and access to the information society.Implications for RehabilitationThe built-in accessibility features of smartphones provide disabled youth a non-stigmatizing practical platform for social participation and access to education.Training material on how to use smartphone accessibility features needs to be made easily available to schools and all disabled youth worldwide.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Many of the ways in which artifacts appear to or actually do affect us—as elegant, dynamic, comfortable, authentic—are based on the fact that they are designed objects. Design is an effect-oriented process that resorts to design rules linking formal aspects of designed artifacts to specific design effects. Design rhetoric tries to capture these links between design techniques and resulting effects. This article presents design-rhetorical methods of identifying design rules of intersubjective validity. The new approach, developed at Bern University of the Arts, combines rhetorical design analysis with practice-oriented design research, based on the creation and empirical testing of design variants in accordance with effect hypotheses.},
  note = {“His concept of “design argument” puts forward the idea that even industrial design objects such as lamps, bookshelves, or coffee machines incorporate quasi-rhetorical modes of influence. According to Buchanan, the impact on viewers and users is exerted by the technological (logos), characteristic (ethos), or emotional (pathos) features of designed objects.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 334)
\par
\subsection{Design Rhetorics nach dem Berner Model}

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
Effekte von Design Artefakten können analysiert werden, indem Design als rhetorischer Process verstanden wird

\item 
Es gibt kein Effekt-freies oder nicht-rhetorisches Design

\item 
Die drei rhetorischen Dimensionen logos, ethos und pathos könne eingesetzt werden, um drei Kategorien visueller Effekte zu definieren. Design-Artefakte beeinflussen uns auf rationeller/funktionelle Ebene (logos), verkörpern einen spezifischen Charakter oder beeinflussen unsere Werte (ethos) und stimulieren unsere Emotionen (pathos).

\item 
Die Beziehung zwischen formalen Mitteln und deren visuellen (haptischen, etc) Effekten kann in Design-Regeln beschrieben werden.

\item 
Das decorum oder aptum bennent das überliegende rhetorische Prinzip, welches den Möglichkeitsraum der Abweichungen von den Regeln umschreibt.

\end{enumerate}

\par
There is an interesting bit on the methodology. After a theoretical analysis, variants of a design were produced to test the different effects.
\par
“The design rules were explored and determined by a rhetorical design analysis of existing graphic artifacts. After theoretical analysis, a practice-based research method was developed and applied. The validity of the design rules was tested by first creating graphic design variants according to specific design rules and by then examining the actual effects of the designed objects on observers.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 338)
\par
\subsection{Methodisches Vorgehen der Analyse}

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
Formale Analyse: Beschreibung von formalen und stilistischen Elementen sowie Kontextualisierung

\item 
Effekt-Analyse: welche Effekte produziert das gestaltete Objekt

\item 
Ausarbeitung der vorhandenen Gestaltungsregeln: Korrelation von formalen Mitteln und Effekten

\item 
Rekonstruktion der beabsichtigten Effekte durch Interviews mit den Designer*innen

\item 
Identifizierung von kontra-intentionalen Faktoren

\item 
Anwendung des Konzepts decorum (Angemessenheit) und Festlegung eines möglichen Handlungsspielraums bei der Erstellung von Entwürfen

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{“How to Determine the Effects of Designed Objects?” (Schneller, 2015, p. 339)}

\par
“A major difficulty of rhetorical-design analysis is the determination of the actual effects of design artifacts.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 339)
\par
Weil Effekte dermassen variabel und Kontext-abhängig sind, muss sicher gestellt werden, dass nicht einfach irgend etwas zugeschrieben wird.
\par
“In the first project, a triangulation of researchers was used to eliminate individual bias in effect ascription; every design artifact was analyzed independently by several members of the project team.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 341)
\par
Ein weiterer Ansatz sind die Speedometer Scales.
\par
(Schneller, 2015, p. 342)
\par
Hier verschwinden die individuellen Biase nicht, sondern sind gleichzeitig mit einer Konvergenz aller Eindrücke dargestellt.
\par
\subsection{Decorum}

\par
“From a design-rhetorical point of view, the character and strength of the generated effect depend on the decorum, that is, whether the design seems appropriate to the beholder in a given context.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 343)
\par
Die Frage ist als nicht nur, wie wirkt das Design auf dich, sondern weiterhin, stimmt der Effekt für dich in der gegebenen Situation?
\par
\subsection{Source Triangulation}

\par
Es ist nicht immer ganz einfach festzustellen ob Effekte formal und direkt entstehen oder indirekt durch Gestaltungsregeln. Für dieses Problem wurde eine Source Triangulation eingesetzt.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Das gestaltete Objekt

\item 
Experten-Interviews

\item 
Design Manuals

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Rules}

\par
Es ist zwar äusser schwierig, Gestaltungsregeln zwischen Effekten und formalen Elementen zu definieren, aber:
\par
“Nevertheless, there seem to be—and indeed need to be for graphic design and visual rhetoric to actually work—general means-effect relationships that can be stated in design rules.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 347)
\par
Es kam wieder Triangulation von Quellen und Forschenden zum Einsatz.
\par
\subsection{Practice-based Research}

\par
Um die Effekt-Hypothesen zu überprüfen, wurden Design-Artefakte hergestellt und getestet. Die Leitfrage dabei war: Können visuelle Effekt bewusst generiert werden, indem Gestaltungsregeln angewendet werden? Welche Kontexte forcieren oder verzerren den gewünschten Effekt?
\par
“On the whole, however, the adopted method of practice-based design research proved to be a powerful heuristic for the rule-based generation and testing of design effects.” (Schneller, 2015, p. 352)},

Patterns and pattern languages present an approach to knowledge presentation in a semi-formalized way that has been used in many domains to help address complex wicked problems effectively. We intend for these patterns to make the knowledge of the LIMITS community more accessible. Moreover, we propose that these patterns could help people apply the core findings from the LIMITS work in real-life situations and, because patterns are intended to be used contextually, help them better understand where they are well-suited and where they are not. Patterns function only through application in, and adjustment to, local contexts, and this knowledge can spur their eventual integration into practices. Our hypothesis is that this work will be useful in at least four ways: (1) sharing the pattern and pattern language (PPL) perspective; (2) sharing useful patterns; (3) providing insights into the processes involved in developing patterns and pattern languages; and (4) providing a flexible, evolving platform for PPL work.},

  abstract = {As the influence of algorithmic systems has grown, critics have come to appreciate that algorithms are not autonomous technical forces, but rather heterogeneous sociotechnical systems. The people who build and maintain these infrastructures play integral roles in their functioning: in the tight and continuous cycles of contemporary software development, the thinking of developers shapes how data drives ‘data-driven’ organizations. This article contributes to contemporary debates on infrastructural politics by describing how the vernacular social theorizing of one group of developers tangles with their technical work. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with developers of music recommender systems in the US, I examine how they understand the variability of music listeners. I find that the dominant frame for making sense of listener variation is avidity: a level of enthusiasm for music, which manifests as a willingness to expend effort in finding listening material. For people working in this industry, avidity displaces other ways of understanding human variety – particularly demography. While the technical communities behind these systems were predominantly white and male, they understood the difference that set them apart from most users to be their enthusiasm for music. Centreing avidity provided a way to claim elite cultural status and to avoid talking about demographic diversity. It also reflects the infrastructures through which recommender system developers know and intervene upon their users: avidity is what users look like when seen through interaction logs. Less avid users leave fewer traces, and the goal of the recommender system is to encourage them to leave more. As a result, the figure of the less avid listener serves to justify increasingly rapacious data collection practices.},

In the case of music recommendations the concept of avidity was centered.

\end{itemize}

\par
“Avidity manifests as an interest in musical exploration or a willingness to expend effort in pursuit of new music.” (Seaver, 2021, p. 773)
\par
-
\par
in 2014 the technical workforce of Google and others were predominantly white and male.
\par
Critics located algorithmic failures in this lack of diversity since they view algorithms as socio-technical systems with human actants playing a crucial role.
\par
The paper argues that how the developers of such algorithms think about their social differences between themselves and the users have consequences for the design of the algorithms.
\par
“In this article, I examine how people working within algorithmic infrastructures make sense of these concerns: How do they think about the composition of their teams, the differences between themselves and their users, and the resulting technical consequences? I suggest that their vernacular social theorizing is entangled with the infrastructures that they build. As they think about what sets them apart from their users, and how that difference might be ameliorated, they find answers in the infrastructure.” (Seaver, 2021, p. 773)
\par
Recommender system are thought of as post-demographic systems, because they go beyond classical categories of race, gender and age. Instead they operate upon the difference between developers and users. Within this context, demographic diversity was deemed unimportant, for at least until 2014.
\par
As quoted from said conference panel:
\par
“the technical functioning of recommendation ‘really comes down to the data, and the feedback, and how you process that information to make your product better’.” (Seaver, 2021, p. 775)
\par
The diversity of the team developing the service doesn’t matter for the endproduct here.
\par
Collaborative filter is the status quo in recommender systems.
\par
“people who liked the same things in the past will probably like the same things in the future. Collaborative filters analyze interactional data, like ratings given to movies or the time spent listening to a particular musical artist, and find patterns in it. When users share much of their listening history, their inferred preferences can be used to make recommendations to each other.” (Seaver, 2021, p. 775)
\par
Collaborative filtering can transform “thin” interactional data into recommendations that seem to be culturally informed, without know anything about that culture. It was also positioned as a way out of demographic framing, although early material didn’t know anything about those problematics. The companies developing recommender algorithms rather collect and evaluate behavioral data, saying that they are post-demographic and post-identity.
\par
This is a rather priviledged stance, as post-identity is marked as white and male and behavioral data is influenced by social facts.
\par
“‘not all efforts at segmentation and targeting are associated with commercial exploitation, marketplace discrimination and cumulative disadvantage’ (2011, p. 133). In other applications of related technologies – like predictive policing, for instance – the dynamics of biased data collection, extreme power differentials, and self-reinforcing feedback call for much stronger critique” (Seaver, 2021, p. 777)
\par
Although they tried hard to not make a demographic difference, there still are underlying differences at play. As a comment on the avidity pyramid, Jennings said
\par
“Such categories are always evolving’ (p. 31). However, he continued, ‘Whether or not the subgroups are empirically watertight does not matter [...] the main point here is simply the existence of different groups’” (Seaver, 2021, p. 779)
\par
Nonetheless avidity became a central cornerstone in the understanding of music listeners by the developers and Jennings original comment vanished into the background. Avidity often stood for gender demographics in internal discussions of developers.
\par
The four categories of the pyramid were later abstraced into lean-forward (as in avid) and lean-backwards (as in non-avid). The large part of the users were lean-back, which was different from the developers, who where mostly lean-forward.
\par
“Avidity was thus a frame not only for understanding listener variation, but also for thinking about the cultural differences between the people who used recommender systems and the people who made them.” (Seaver, 2021, p. 780)
\par
It seems like, that tech culture, or silicon valley culture, wants to position itself as neutral. Which is interesting in relation to the facebook paper. But having cultural capital avidity seemed very important in getting a job at a music recommender developer company, which already framed the team and it’s diversity. This was critiqued as culture fit which was a homogenizing force.
\par
In tech general, but the music recommender field, qualitative research in user (experience) seemed very sparse, leading to the development of products for the developers themselves. This led to further differentiation between developers and users as devs couldn’t imagine themselves as users. They tried to overcome this problem through data. Data was seen as objective (as in subconcious and non.lying)
\par
\textbf{Seeing like an infrastructure}
\par
“This is not to say that people like Tom were unaware that their users had lives extending beyond their platform; rather, for the purposes of recommendation, those lives were only relevant to the extent that they manifested as detectable patterns in interaction. If the goal of the recommender was to encourage listeners to stay listening, its success could be measured by how much these profiles grew over time” (Seaver, 2021, p. 785)
\par
\textbf{Seeing like a market}
\par
“‘data imperative’: ‘professionals recommend, the institutional environment demands, and technology enables organizations to sweep up as much individual data as possible’ (2017, p. 13). This speculation on the value of data leads to a situation that Fourcade and Healy call ‘seeing like a market’–the valorization of data as a new form of capital” (Seaver, 2021, p. 786)

The present review aims to highlight accessible features and apps along with usages, including educational, and access to smartphones as assistive technology for visual impairment and blindness. It also includes advantages and challenges faced by users, and usability testing by app developers. There have been significant recent developments in mobile technology that incorporate computer technology relating to electronic information, communication, and touch-screen accessibility. Such advances in technology are transforming the use of smartphones from a traditional visual interface to a truly visual free interaction using alternative body senses, such as haptic, gesture, and so on. There are many built-in accessible features and third-party accessible applications that enable people with visual impairment to perform daily activities, independent functioning, movement, social inclusion and participation, education, etc. They are universally designed, so they are unlikely to induce social stigma or negative reactions from peers or public. Healthcare practitioners, not limiting to eye care, and caregivers, family members, teachers, or special educators should be informed about the potential uses and benefits of smartphones for visually impaired in developing nations. Evidence shows that most of the users train by themselves. Enhancing the awareness along with training for teachers and caregivers would be helpful to improve access and skills among users with visual disabilities. Developers are continuously producing more innovative applications for visual impairment, which indicates the need for having a training guideline on the use of smartphones.},

But as these agents have grown more realistic, concerns have been raised over how their social nature might unconsciously shape our interactions with them. Through a survey of 500 voice assistant users, we explore whether users' relationships with their voice assistants can be quantified using the same metrics as social, interpersonal relationships; as well as if this correlates with how much they trust their devices and the extent to which they anthropomorphise them. Using Knapp's staircase model of human relationships, we find that not only can human-device interactions be modelled in this way, but also that relationship development with voice assistants correlates with increased trust and anthropomorphism.},

As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.},

“Media archives therefore never just describe the processes and institutions of storing text and images, nor do they attribute any unalterable informing power or signifying force. Rather, they demonstrate every medium’s stratagem to selectively depict and represent ‘actuality’.” (Sieber, 2016, p. 25)

-{$>$} What is the “actuality” in the case of Github?
\par
“Already in the ancient residences of superior magistrates filing official documents, archives, according to Derrida, “needed at once a guardian and a localization”, and thus “could neither do without substrate nor without residence” (Derrida 1998: 2). Archives therefore “take place in a domiciliation”, and their ‘documents’ are “only kept and classified under the title of the archive by virtue of a privileged topology”” (Sieber, 2016, p. 26)
\par
“Such consignation or gathering, strictly speaking, implies “to coordinate a single corpus, in a system or a synchrony in which all the elements articulate the unity of an ideal configuration” and no “absolute dissociation, [...] heterogeneity or secret” can persist” (Sieber, 2016, p. 27)
\par
So questions of power are quite interesting. By taking all of the open source code and quasi locking it away, with any access by anyone other then github (and the people wirking at the vault) GH amasses a lot of power.},

Engineering ethics, on the other hand, recommends enhancing users’ functionality, even if functioning is not achieved in a species typical way. From this engineering perspective, it is permissible and even desirable for assistive technology to make its users function even better than new. Thus enhancing functionality is a central value in assistive technology. Professionals in the field have the ability, and the responsibility as well, to address and counter societal suspicion of artificially enhanced functioning achieved through technology. Consequently, assistive technology professionals should fight against discrimination that excludes people with disabilities, whose functioning depends on prostheses and other products of technology, from the mainstream of social life.},

We adopt a product semantics view to discuss research as design. Product semantics highlights the meaning of artifacts with respect to their (i) stakeholders, (ii) artifacts-in-use, (iii), artifacts-in-language, (iv) artifact lifecycle, and (v) ecology. Based on this interpretation, we propose activities that should characterize the practice of doing design research. Finally we provide an example of Design Research Practice in action.},

The entire ICT supply chain should move towards a more systemic view of the infosphere. This paper proposes the concept of Slow Tech as a heuristic compass for finding new directions in the design of future complex socio-technical systems, by paying attention to ICT that are good, clean, and fair, socially desirable, environmentally sustainable, and ethically acceptable.Key words: ICT, Slow Tech, Anthropocene},

  abstract = {The emergence of ‘Maker Culture’ and ‘Maker Spaces’ within formal (and informal) learning environments around the world can be seen as part of a wider shift in consciousness regarding the relationship between human and the material environment. This is reflected in theoretical and academic movements such as the ‘material turn’: where concepts such as Jane Bennett’s ‘vibrant matter’ and Karen Barad’s ‘intra-activity’ have begun to displace human intention as the exclusive centre of agency. In this article, an engagement with DiY (Do-it-Yourself ) technologies is explored through an observation of the workshop environment of a single practitioner: uncovering strategies which allow material agency to re-function simple technologies into forms which would be difficult to reproduce using exclusively human intention. Deviating from the role of technology as an invisibly functioning tool, material media is defined as an approach to technologies which incorporates materials as active agents in the creative process of making of cultural artefacts. Through the use of redundant and discarded materials, the DiY practitioner examined in this article is seen to follow a Techno-Animist approach to media technologies: acknowledging the qualities of ‘vibrant matter’as an active component of agency; re-situating the human in relation to the material environment.},

Many people appear reconciled to using available products that, at best, match functionalities to compensate for physical deficiencies. Yet people express a desire for personalized, elegant, discreet and bold artefacts that match their lifestyle and provide opportunities for self-expression. This study adopts a materiality-inspired methodology to explore ATs and to elicit insights into the perceptions and emotions of the study participants towards them. A comparative exploratory study between the UK and Taiwan has been conducted to explore diverse and cross-cultural perceptions. The findings suggest that the design of ATs needs to go beyond traditional considerations, such as price and compliance, and instead focus on how these products enhance users’ positive sense of self. This in return may increase the rate of successful adoption of ATs in everyday life.},

Infrastructure is both relational and ecological—it means different things to different groups and it is part of the balance of action, tools, and the built environment, inseparable from them. It also is frequently mundane to the point of boredom, involving things such as plugs, standards, and bureaucratic forms. Some of the difficulties of studying infrastructure are how to scale up from traditional ethnographic sites, how to manage large quantities of data such as those produced by transaction logs, and how to understand the interplay of online and offline behavior. Some of the tricks of the trade involved in meeting these challenges include studying the design of infrastructure, understanding the paradoxes of infrastructure as both transparent and opaque, including invisible work in the ecological analysis, and pinpointing the epistemological status of indictors.},

Based on current debates on the growing relevance of archival documents in American Studies and adjacent fields, it stakes out a framework that leans on recent work in a small branch of contemporary literary theory focused on historical epistemology, especially with regard to the notion of ‘epistemic objects’. Engaging these theoretical concerns, the article discusses concrete archival collections and documents, including letters by the novelist Willa Cather and items from a capacious archive documenting the emergence and evolution of Andrew Carnegie’s public library philanthropy. I outline several ways in which the shape and the aesthetics of such archives embody the information economies and epistemic situations of the past – in this case, the formative period around 1900. Finally, the article addresses the digital document overload that confronts the contemporary researcher and comments on the emerging archival knowledge culture of today’s humanities.},

  abstract = {The invisibility of functional infrastructures has become a truism. Although infrastructures are invisible in many ways—because of their size, because they are hidden, or because they are so foundational—those whose livelihoods are endangered by infrastructures are keenly aware of them. In-person and online action against the Dakota Access Pipeline brought dramatic attention to oil infrastructure even though the pipeline was not only not visible, it was not yet built. I argue that the practices that make infrastructure perceptible—whether technological, geographical, social, or historical—are also always political. This study sets the efforts of Oceti Sokowin, other Indigenous, and non-Indigenous water protectors into the context of U.S. infrastructure history to examine the wide-ranging effects of the dominance of sight in infrastructural awareness and to make the case that infrastructures are not normally functional, whether by inevitable accident or in the more fundamental failure of infrastructures’ imbrication with settler colonialism in North America. Rerouting entrenched habits of perception helps to correct some of the damaging legacies of using sight as a metric for value, to foreground the fundamental nature of infrastructural breakdown, and to expand definitions of infrastructures to better account for their far-reaching and diverse dependencies and effects.},

“Im kollaborativen Aushandeln werden schließlich die unterschiedlichen Vorstellungen jedes einzelnen Teammitglieds aktiviert, erinnert, verbalisiert oder auch verschwiegen. Individuelles Codewissen wird gegen bestehendes Erfahrungswissen und mögliche Lösungsansätze abgewogen, im Komplex der Aushandlungen argumentieren die Entwickler*innen über eine als kollektiv sinnvoll erachtete Vorgehensweise. Die jeweils persönlichen, inneren Vollzüge des Wissens ›äußern‹ sich hier im Diskurs, Interpretationen der Aufgabenstellungen werden verbalisiert und so~ – idealerweise~– ein situativer Konsens erzeugt. Im Darüber-Sprechen geschieht Verständigung, persönliche Wissensbestände werden kollektiv aktualisiert und so die Grundlage für gemeinsames, reibungsloseres Arbeiten hergestellt.” (Tischberger, 2021, p. 145)

  abstract = {Design is regarded in the article as an ontological instrument that is able to transform the social and cultural reality, and model human experience, subjectivity and environment. I focus on the intersections between Tony Fry’s understanding of ontological design and the decolonial interpretation of modernity/coloniality as an overall design determining relation between the world, the things and the humans. The article attempts to draw a division between the positive (re-existent) and negative (defuturing) ontological designs. It addresses the coloniality of design that is control and disciplining of our perception and interpretation of the world, of other beings and things according to certain legitimized principles. The coloniality of design has accompanied the predominant modern universalist utopias such as Marxism or Liberalism and has been resisted internally and externally through various manifestations of border thinking and existence. I analyze Fry’s concept of defuturing in relation to the decolonial concept of pluriversality. This allows to address in more detail the dynamic correlational principle as central to decolonial ontological design. Among specific decolonial tools of positive ontological design I focus on Sumak Kawsay, Earth Democracy, and a few more specific initiatives originating in the indigenous social movements from Eurasian borderlands. The article also addresses decolonizing of the affective sphere as ground for a positive ontological design. Finally I argue for the necessity of provincializing the Western/Northern design and allowing the decolonial design in the Global South develop its positive border “both and” positionality, a negotiating transcultural stance starting from the local geopolitics and corpo-politics put into dialogue and dispute with the modern/ colonial defuturing design premises.},

While there is exponential growth in the information transferred between the creator and the archive, the information flow between the archive and the user is often leaky—discontinuous and disrupted. There is a considerable interval between the time archival material are accessioned, processed, and made accessible for research. It is in this space that what archivists euphemistically call ‘the backlog’ comes into existence. What the backlog interrupts is the distribution and consumption end of the research process. As a concept and a reality, the backlog is a critical point of failure, carrying with it an ongoing and prevailing sense that ‘deferred maintenance’ has become the norm in the archive. In this article, focus is placed on framing and understanding the backlog as an infrastructural problem and on highlighting the conflict inherent in various forms of discourse seeking solutions to it.},

Diese sind für die Untersuchung der komplexen, oft durch digitale Medien und Netzmedien vermittelten Text-Bild- Video-Kombinationen allerdings oft noch wenig geeignet. Diskursanalytische Ansätze bieten allerdings die Möglichkeit, diese Forschung weiterzuentwickeln. Im Aufsatz wird zunächst der Stand der diskursanalytischen Diskussion um den Status der Bilder rekapituliert, um dann drei Ebenen einer visuellen Diskursanalyse vorzustellen: Fokussierte Hermeneutiken, Analyse der Grammatisierungen und eine Untersuchung diskursiver Prozesse. Abschließend wird argumentiert, dass dieser Zugang besonders für die Untersuchung der Bildverwendung in kommunikativ angelegten Medienverhältnissen angelegt ist. Schlagwörter: Visuelle Diskursanalyse, Bildhermeneutik, digitale Medien, Kommunikation, Informationsgesellschaft In recent years, different methodologies and methods of visual analyses have been developed in the social sciences. However, these methods are often not well suited for researching complex mediated combinations of text, image and video. Methodologies of discourse analysis offer the opportunity to further develop visual sociology. Three levels of a visual discourse analysis are discussed: focussed hermeneutics, analysis of grammatisations, and the study of discursive processes. In the conclusion, it is argued that this approach is especially useful for the study of images in media conditions which foster communicative practices.

  abstract = {Universal design is the design of buildings, products or environments to make them accessible to all people, regardless of age, disability or other factors. The term "universal design" was coined by the architect Ronald Mace to describe the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life. However, it was the work of Selwyn Goldsmith, author of Designing for the Disabled (1963), who really pioneered the concept of free access for people with disabilities. His most significant achievement was the creation of the dropped curb – now a standard feature of the built environment. Universal design emerged from slightly earlier barrier-free concepts, the broader accessibility movement, and adaptive and assistive technology and also seeks to blend aesthetics into these core considerations. As life expectancy rises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in universal design. There are many industries in which universal design is having strong market penetration but there are many others in which it has not yet been adopted to any great extent. Universal design is also being applied to the design of technology, instruction, services, and other products and environments. Curb cuts or sidewalk ramps, essential for people in wheelchairs but also used by all, are a common example.  Color-contrast dishware with steep sides that assists those with visual or dexterity problems are another.  There are also cabinets with pull-out shelves, kitchen counters at several heights to accommodate different tasks and postures, and, amidst many of the world's public transit systems, low-floor buses that "kneel" (bring their front end to ground level to eliminate gap) and/or are equipped with ramps rather than on-board lifts.},

  abstract = {The computer is no longer the center of attention. Thus, what we design is no longer the interface to the computer. Rather, what we design is a thing or an environment in which a computer might be used to create certain desired effects. Indeed, interaction design in a sense becomes the practice of giving form to artifacts or environments rather like any of the other design disciplines that we have know for centuries. However, giving form to computational things is highly complex and somewhat different than most other form-giving practices due to its temporal form element – its ability to change between states. Thus, an interaction design practice needs to encompass this temporal form-giving in combination with physical form-giving, and performances of the interaction gestalt. In this paper I propose this trinity of forms as a framework to unfold the practice of interaction design. I further demonstrate how computational composites present a way to work with the temporal form and the physical form in a process not too different from any traditional form-giving practice. Lastly, I point to some tools and techniques to deal with the interdependencies of the three form-elements and thereby also demonstrate that a form-giving practice of interaction design is already well under way.},

  abstract = {We describe the future technology workshop (FTW), a method whereby people with everyday knowledge or experience in a specific area of technology use (such as using digital cameras) envision and design the interactions between current and future technology and activity. Through a series of structured workshop sessions, participants collaborate to envisage future activities related to technology design; build models of the contexts of use for future technologies; act out scenarios of use for their models; re-conceive their scenarios in relation to present-day technologies; list problems with implementing the scenarios; explore the gap between current and future technology and activity; and end by listing requirements for future technology. The method has been used successfully with children and adults to explore new technology–activity systems, including interacting with digital photographs and informal science learning.},

  abstract = {For over 20 years, the concept of the virtual has prevailed in French digital studies. Yet two decades of daily cultural integration with interfaces have demonstrated that virtuality is only one of many aspects of our interactive experience with digital devices. A need therefore exists for new concepts more apt to address the philosophical complexity of the digital phenomenon and the signi cance of our interactions with calculated matter as they are true existential experiences of phenomenological signi cance. In this chapter I explain why I have suggested introducing the phenomenological concept of ontophany (manifestation of being). In close relationship with a comprehensive and broadened understanding of Bachelard’s notion of “phenomenotechnique,” I examine the hitherto unidenti ed technicality of this manifestation process. Prior to their existence as tools in uses, technologies are rst the perceptual structure of our existence; they are the “devices” or the invisible matrixes, produced by culture and history, into which our potential experience-ofthe-world is cast. Not only do the following theoretical propositions seek to contribute, philosophically, to Internet Studies and to a better understanding the Digital Age, they also hope to give rise to a broader deliberation on technology and perception, as they relate to an approach I would characterize as a historical phenomenology of technology.},

  abstract = {Mid-air interaction involves touchless manipulations of digital content or remote devices, based on sensor tracking of body movements and gestures. There are no established, universal gesture vocabularies for mid-air interactions with digital content or remote devices based on sensor tracking of body movements and gestures. On the contrary, it is widely acknowledged that the identification of appropriate gestures depends on the context of use, thus the identification of mid-air gestures is an important design decision. The method of gesture elicitation is increasingly applied by designers to help them identify appropriate gesture sets for mid-air applications. This paper presents a review of elicitation studies in mid-air interaction based on a selected set of 47 papers published within 2011–2018. It reports on: (1) the application domains of mid-air interactions examined; (2) the level of technological maturity of systems at hand; (3) the gesture elicitation procedure and its variations; (4) the appropriateness criteria for a gesture; (5) participants number and profile; (6) user evaluation methods (of the gesture vocabulary); (7) data analysis and related metrics. This paper confirms that the elicitation method has been applied extensively but with variability and some ambiguity and discusses under-explored research questions and potential improvements of related research.},

It shows how this new industrial development becomes a part of state-making and regional identity-building processes by triggering the re-scaling of territories and shaping new geographies in relation to expanding cloud infrastructures. Tracing those infrastructure-making processes reveals some of the key dynamics between the Swedish state, its regions and the global IT economy.},

"• that design is something far more pervasive and profound than is generally recognised by designers, cultural theorists, philosophers or lay persons; • that designing is fundamental to being human — we design, that is to say, we deliberate, plan and scheme in ways which prefigure our actions and makings — in turn we are designed by our designing and by that which we have designed (i.e., through our interactions with the structural and material specificities of our environments); • that this adds up to a double movement — we design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us."

"once the fabricated object leaves the factory, there is the way in which it will design the actions of its users, according to the inherent delimitations of how it can be used — here we can think of equipment, appliances and other functional objects as having 'horizons of use', similar to Gadamer's notion of interpretation as 'an interaction between the horizon provided by the text and the horizon that the interpreter brings to it'.[13] Interpretation is inseparable from the ontological designing process.[14]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=3}{Willis 2006:71})
\par
"The risk is a loss of specificity in which ontological designing could be seen as equivalent to 'environmental determinism', carrying no more agency than 'influence' (as in 'the influence of environment upon individuals', where neither what constitutes environment nor what kind of action 'influence' is, are ever spelt out)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=3}{Willis 2006:71})

"Interpretation happens in innumerable ordinary everyday situations, such as when something breaks down and the user has to examine it in order to fix it. This produces an understanding of how the thing works, which is not the same as knowing how to use it, and furthermore the understanding gained will very likely modify the way in which it is used in future (how it's held, how much pressure is applied, etc); nevertheless the interpretation didn't start from ground zero, from a position of absolute objectivity, it came out of an everyday involvement which carried with it a particular understanding of the functioning of the thing, but the breakdown opened up a space for interpretation, an opportunity towards disclosure of the thing itself."

"(i) we are born into and come to be human in language; (ii) we appropriate it, modify it, perhaps put words together in ways that they have not been combined before, encounter new situations which require new words; (iii) thus in appropriating language we also change it, and language-as-changed in turn acts back on us as language users.[18]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=5}{Willis 2006:73})

\par
"The weight and agency of design here depends upon where the emphasis is read — if 'designed for' is read as 'allowed for' this would suggest that the occupants' journey though time also had some other manifestation which was only facilitated by the (designed) artefactual spaces of their dwelling." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=7}{Willis 2006:75})

In its holding, the jug thus performs a profound gathering, which is also a giving, for the jug is also designed for outpouring. Its outpouring quenches thirst, its outpouring is a gift: in the gift of water, in the gift of wine, sky and earth dwell. But the gift of the outpouring is what makes the jug a jug.

  abstract = {This paper illuminates how gendered stereotypes can be leveraged to assuage anxieties surrounding artificially intelligent virtual assistants (AI VA). In particular, the analysis shows that these AI objects routinely traffic in normative gender roles of the feminine as caretaker, mother, and wife in order to obfuscate modes of surveillance, and mediate the relationship users and potential users have with late-capitalist market logics in the platform economy. Mobilizing essentialist feminine personas characterized in this paper as “digital domesticity,” artificially intelligent objects orient users to engage productively with surveillance capitalism as natural. To illustrate this relationship between femininity and surveillance, this paper focuses on two case studies of AI VA. The essay turns to Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa as emblematic of AI VA that perform a stereotypically feminine persona that invites users to participate in increasingly intimate forms of data exchange that in turn contribute to surveillance capitalism. The study of AI VA, like Siri and Alexa, demonstrates the significant rhetorical capacities of the feminine persona as they are applied to objects with weak (that is, limited) artificial intelligence.},

The essay introduces the notion of xenodesign, an approach guided by principles and theories from speculative design as well as from xeno discourses and speculative realism, which are characterized by an engagement with experiences and perspectives beyond the human and an understanding of all entities on an equal level — humans, ecologies, bacteria, air, soil, artificial intelligences, etc. It explores what might constitute a xenodesignerly practice in three approaches, illustrated through examples from design.},

The approach is challenging in that it involves matching key cognitive principles for a given problem domain to engineering principles, and that an independent validation procedure is required for the cognitive component. In addition, we argue for a broad set of evaluation criteria and adapt a participatory design framework, one that involves the client population throughout the design process. After laying out the main precepts of the approach, we illustrate these via a particular design process, seeking to provide situational awareness and navigational assistance to persons who are blind. The problem domain is described in some detail. A solution is then presented that involves matching the need for configural knowledge about the person's surroundings with a hierarchical organisation in the spatial database so that information may be presented to the user at different levels of detail. The process involved to implement this solution is then outlined, and appropriate validation experiments described. It is noted that the cognitive design process as presented here is in use now in a number of initiatives, and that it involves a high degree of collaboration between experts from different disciplines.},

  abstract = {Background: A voice assistant (VA) is inanimate audio-interfaced software augmented with artificial intelligence, capable of 2-way dialogue, and increasingly used to access health care advice. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common perinatal mood disorder with an annual estimated cost of \$14.2 billion. Only a small percentage of PPD patients seek care due to lack of screening and insufficient knowledge of the disease, and this is, therefore, a prime candidate for a VA-based digital health intervention. Objective: In order to understand the capability of VAs, our aim was to assess VA responses to PPD questions in terms of accuracy, verbal response, and clinically appropriate advice given. Methods: This cross-sectional study examined four VAs (Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft Cortana) installed on two mobile devices in early 2020. We posed 14 questions to each VA that were retrieved from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) patient-focused Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on PPD. We scored the VA responses according to accuracy of speech recognition, presence of a verbal response, and clinically appropriate advice in accordance with ACOG FAQ, which were assessed by two board-certified physicians. Results: Accurate recognition of the query ranged from 79\% to 100\%. Verbal response ranged from 36\% to 79\%. If no verbal response was given, queries were treated like a web search between 33\% and 89\% of the time. Clinically appropriate advice given by VA ranged from 14\% to 29\%. We compared the category proportions using the Fisher exact test. No single VA statistically outperformed other VAs in the three performance categories. Additional observations showed that two VAs (Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana) included advertisements in their responses. Conclusions: While the best performing VA gave clinically appropriate advice to 29\% of the PPD questions, all four VAs taken together achieved 64\% clinically appropriate advice. All four VAs performed well in accurately recognizing a PPD query, but no VA achieved even a 30\% threshold for providing clinically appropriate PPD information. Technology companies and clinical organizations should partner to improve guidance, screen patients for mental health disorders, and educate patients on potential treatment.},

We hypothesized that excessive object attachment is an attempt to compensate for unmet relatedness needs. We tested this hypothesis in two studies by examining whether object attachment mediates the relationship between loneliness and HD using bootstrapped multiple regression analyses in a community sample (Study 1; n = 213) and an undergraduate sample of individuals with high hoarding symptoms (Study 2: n = 91). Participants in both studies completed self-report measures of loneliness, object attachment, and hoarding symptoms. Study 2 also accounted for the possible confounding effects of age and depressive symptoms. Results from both studies showed that loneliness and object attachment were positively associated with HD symptoms. Study 1 showed that object attachment mediated the relationship between loneliness and HD symptoms, and Study 2 showed a significant mediation even after accounting for age and depression. Results provide justification for further experimental and longitudinal research into loneliness as both a cause and consequence of object attachment and HD.

  abstract = {Children’s play objects are increasingly shaped by technological innovations that can transform them into hybrid, internet-connected toys, a phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Toys. Previous research has presented user research on connected toys, but little is known how to approach them from a design perspective. This paper investigates whether and how an animistic design perspective can foster a fruitful exploration of the design potentialities of connected toys. It addresses this question by analysing three design concepts of connected toys that were developed in the course of an R\&D project. These included a high-tech bracelet with digital passport, a card game with a customizable 3D-printed figurine, and a robot as a board game play mate. The results show how the design qualities of connected toys can be categorized on a spectrum ranging from a certainty-driven, problem-solving logic to an uncertainty-driven, animistic design perspective. The contribution of this study is a better understanding of how connected toys emerge in a broader ecology of children, toys, and data that all act upon each other. By embracing the uncertainty in this complex and fluid network of subjects and objects, the animistic design perspective allows to explore a broad set of design opportunities relevant in the realm of the Internet of Toys.},

"Animistic design considers a broad chorus of voices, actions, and perspectives that act upon each other often in uncertain and unpredictable ways [3:2251].

"'milieu' instead, i.e., the broader ecology, the "ambient, atmosphere, or circumstance" [24:58] in which various agents (objects and subjects) are related to each other, through embodied entanglements [2], and with increasingly unstable and uncertain boundaries [23]. We believe an animistic design perspective is promising to guide the analysis and exploration of the design qualities of connected toys."

"By doing so, we aimed to move beyond an isolated artefact-centred evaluation that would only present design instances, and reflect on the design potentialities at an abstraction level that potentially could cut across particular use situations, instead."

"The scientific value of this paper is that its animistic design perspective puts connected toys in a broader context of various agents, i.e., objects and subjects that all act upon each other, often in unpredictable ways.

"An animistic design perspective challenges interaction designers to design for an expressiveness of animated objects with intent, while positioning them in a wide ecology of human-object entanglements" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=2}{Zaman et al 2018:171})

"Rather than being concerned with the attribution of spiritual or religious power to beings and nature elements, Laurel was particularly interested in the way people respond to animistic beliefs, i.e., how seeing the world as alive could shape and 'co-design' our behaviors, decisions and creations."

"In a technological context, Laurel invites us to consider an opportunity design space that builds on a model that emerges "from the summed actions of many actors" [20:255] and in which the technology offers opportunities for pleasure rather than for utilitarian and productive purposes."

"Animistic design is characterised by four interwoven principles" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=3}{Zaman et al 2018:172})
\par
"A first key animistic design principle accounts for the way design qualities can evoke a sense of agency." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=3}{Zaman et al 2018:172})
\par
"This brings us to the second and third key principle, namely the embodied nature of objects, that act in a broader ecology" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=3}{Zaman et al 2018:172})
\par
"The animistic design perspective embraces this power of uncertainty, which can be considered as a fourth principle." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=3}{Zaman et al 2018:172})
\par
"children ascribe human and life-like qualities to inanimate object like robots, including cognitive, behavioral, and especially affective characteristics. Similarly, [27] have shown that children conceptualized and interacted with a robotic dog in ways that were like a live dog." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=3}{Zaman et al 2018:172})
\par
"Especially when it concerns smart things and AI agents, people of all ages are likely to consider them as alive (whereas in reality they are not), give them attitude and personality [1] (whereas in reality they are configured), see them as intelligent (whereas they are dumb [23]), having broad capabilities (whereas these are actually rather limited [28]) [2]."

"This study is drawn from a 1.5-year R\&D interdisciplinary project in which academia and industry collaborated to design a scalable framework for the development of connected toys applications that incorporate physical, tradable, personalized cards and toys in an interactive multi-platform media experience. The goal of this project was to iteratively conceptualize, design, and evaluate connected toys concepts and present at least one demonstrator."

The emphasis was on discussing priorities, and defining focus in the multidisciplinary team, with as the ultimate project goal the creation of a workable demonstrator of a connected toys concept."

"The methodological approach for the generation of the concept definition followed the rationale of a design sprint [17], including phases of understanding the design" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=4}{Zaman et al 2018:173})
\par
"Analysis The analysis can be considered as a particular type of expert evaluation, complementing (not replacing) user and technical research. The instances of the three concepts that emerged out of the development weeks (supra), were reanalysed from an animistic design perspective following a 2-step process." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=6}{Zaman et al 2018:175})
\par
"In the first analysis phase, we explored each design concept from the perspective of animistic design, questioning whether and how the design qualities would foster or inhibit 1) agency, 2) embodiment, 3) a certain ecology of objects and subjects, and 4) uncertainty (cf., supra). Based on the analytical lens of agency, we defined new codes relating to 'autonomy', 'domination, 'simulation', and 'negotiation'. The combination of the perspective of agency with the notion of an ecology, led to the definition of the following new codes: '(in)dependence', and 'divergent interactions'. The analytical lens of embodiment and ecology led to an investigation and discussion of 'boundaries' in the connected toys concepts. The notion of uncertainty did not yield new codes during the analysis, but was helpful to further characterize and flesh out each of the new codes presented above." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=6}{Zaman et al 2018:175})
\par
"The Bracelet concept hinted upon several animistic design principles in affording children to interact with it in an ecology of heterogeneous, tangible, networked objects that act upon each other in uncertain ways. It does not rely on the typical command and response pattern present in traditional user-interface interactions. It is indeed an essential characteristic of animistic design "to fit a messy, serendipitous process of constant reassessment, enriching open-ended situations" [3:2255]. The meaning of the Bracelet is incomplete when children do not co-construct its significance, which signifies the embodied nature of animistic design and echoes [23:228] statement that agency in animistic designs is not something that objects have, but only exists in relation to its user(s) or in its encounters with other things and data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=7}{Zaman et al 2018:176})
\par
"We do note, however, that design qualities can afford an animistic interpretation, but even without these qualities being present, children still have the agency to creatively bring these objects to live." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=7}{Zaman et al 2018:176})
\par
"Future studies on animistic design could then consider triangulating data in a research design that combines adult expert evaluations of the design qualities with an analysis of empirical data based on participation of children and parents. Doing so would allow us to actually treat the human and non-human activities on an equal stand, which is a key characteristic of animistic design, and posthumanist research in general."

  abstract = {Derrida and Foucault provide key starting points to understanding archives. They see archives as hegemonic, characterizing ways of thought, modes of colonization, and the control of citizens. However, they also make clear that archives can be read subversively. With patience, counter-readings allow the excavation of the voices (sometimes names) of subaltern and otherwise suppressed others from the archive. By reading along and across the archival grain, researchers can follow the development of ideas and processes across historical periods. Archives can be seen as orphanages, containing surrogates of performances. Archives (paper and digital) also provide access to the results of anthropological research in ways mandated by ethics codes, but these are subject to controversy. What sorts of consent and what sorts of anonymization should be provided? Archives run by the groups traditionally studied by anthropologists provide models of radical archives that are very different from those conceived of by traditional archivists.},

  abstract = {[Epistemic Status: Scroll to the bottom for my follow-up thoughts on this from months/years later.] Early this year, Conor White-Sullivan introduced me to the Zettelkasten method of note-taking. I would say that this significantly increased my research productivity. I’ve been saying “at least 2x”. Naturally, this sort of thing is difficult to quantify. The truth is, I think it may be more like 3x, especially along the dimension of “producing ideas” and also “early-stage development of ideas”. (What I mean by this will become clearer as I describe how I think about research productivity more generally.) However, it is also very possible that the method produces serious biases in the types of ideas produced/developed, which should be considered. (This would be difficult to quantify at the best of times, but also, it should be noted that other factors have dramatically  decreased my overall research productivity. So, unfortunately, someone looking in from outside would not see an overall boost. Still, my impression is that it's been very useful.) I think there are some specific reasons why Zettelkasten has worked so well for me. I’ll try to make those clear, to help readers decide whether it would work for them. However, I honestly didn’t think Zettelkasten sounded like a good idea before I tried it. It only took me about 30 minutes of working with the cards to decide that it was really good. So, if you’re like me, this is a cheap experiment. I think a lot of people should actually try it to see how they like it, even if it sounds terrible. My plan for this document is to first give a short summary and then an overview of Zettelkasten, so that readers know roughly what I’m talking about, and can possibly experiment with it without reading any further. I’ll then launch into a longer discussion of why it worked well for me, explaining the specific habits which I think contributed, including some descriptions of my previous approaches to keeping research notes.
