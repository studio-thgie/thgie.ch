  title = {The {{3D Additivist Manifesto}}},
  journal = {\#Additivism},
  abstract = {Derived from petrochemicals boiled into being from the black oil of a trillion ancient bacterioles, the plastic used in 3D Additive manufacturing is a metaphor before it has even been layered into shape. Its potential belies the complications of its history: that matter is the sum and prolongation of our ancestry; that creativity is brutal, sensual, rude, coarse, and cruel. 1 We declare that the world's splendour has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of crap, kipple 2 and detritus. A planet crystallised with great plastic tendrils like serpents with pixelated breath 3 \ldots for a revolution that runs on disposable armaments is more desirable than the contents of Edward Snowden's briefcase; more breathtaking than The United Nations Legislative Series. There is nothing which our infatuated race would desire to see more than the fertile union between a man and an Analytical Engine. Yet humankind are the antediluvian prototypes of a far vaster Creation. 4 The whole of humankind can be understood as a biological medium, of which synthetic technology is but one modality. Thought and Life~both~have been thoroughly dispersed on the winds of information. 5 Our power and intelligence do not belong specifically to us, but to all matter. 6 Our technologies are the sex organs of material speculation. Any attempt to understand these occurrences is blocked by our own anthropomorphism.~ 7 In order to proceed, therefore, one has to birth posthuman machines, a fantasmagoric and unrepresentable repertoire of actual re-embodiments of the most hybrid kinds. 8 Additivism will be instrumental in accelerating the emergence and encounter with The Radical Outside. 9 Additivism can emancipate us. Additivism will eradicate us. We want to encourage, interfere, and reverse-engineer the possibilities encoded into the censored, the invisible, and the radical notion of the 3D printer itself. To endow the printer with the faculties of plastic: condensing imagination within material reality. 10 The 3D print then becomes a symptom of a systemic malady. An aesthetics of exaptation, 11 with the peculiar beauty to be found in reiteration; in making a mesh. 12 This is where cruelty and creativity are reconciled: in the appropriation of all planetary matter to innovate on biological prototypes. 13 From the purest thermoplastic, from the cleanest photopolymer, and shiniest sintered metals we propose to forge anarchy, revolt and distemper. Let us birth disarray from its digital chamber. To mobilise this entanglement we propose a collective: one figured not only on the resolution of particular objects, but on the change those objects enable as instruments of revolution and systemic disintegration. Just as the printing press, radio, photocopier and modem were saturated with unintended affects, so we seek to express the potential encoded into every one of the 3D printer's gears. Just as a glitch can un-resolve an image, so it can resolve something more posthuman: manifold systems \textendash{} biological, political, computational, material. We call for planetary pixelisation, using Additivist technologies to corrupt the material unconscious; a call that goes on forever in virtue of this initial movement. 14 We call not for passive, dead technologies but rather for a gradual awakening of matter, the emergence, ultimately, of a new form of life. 15 We call for:  The endless re-penning of Additivist Manifestos.  Artistic speculations on matter and its digital destiny.  Texts on:  The Anthropocene  The Chthulucene 16  The Plasticene.~17  Designs, blueprints and instructions for 3D printing:  Tools of industrial espionage  Tools for self-defense against armed assault  Tools to disguise  Tools to aid/disrupt surveillance  Tools to raze/rebuild  Objects beneficial in the promotion of protest, and unrest  Objects for sealing and detaining  Torture devices  Instruments of chastity, and psychological derangement  Sex machines  Temporary Autonomous Drones  Lab equipment used in the production of:  Drugs  Dietary supplements  DNA  Photopolymers and thermoplastics  Stem cells  Nanoparticles. Technical methods for the copying and dissemination of:  Mass-produced components  Artworks  All patented forms  The aura of individuals, corporations, and governments.  Software for the encoding of messages inside 3D objects.  Methods for the decryption of messages hidden inside 3D objects.  Chemical ingredients for dissolving, or catalysing 3D objects.  Hacks/cracks/viruses for 3D print software:  To avoid DRM  To introduce errors, glitches and fissures into 3D prints.  Methods for the reclamation, and recycling of plastic:  Caught in oceanic gyres  Lying dormant in landfills, developing nations, or the bodies of children.  The enabling of biological and synthetic things to become each others prostheses, including:  Skeletal cabling  Nervous system inserts  Lenticular neural tubing  Universal ports, interfaces and orifices.  Additivist and Deletionist methods for exapting 18 androgynous bodies, including:  Skin grafts  Antlers  Disposable exoskeletons  Interspecies sex organs.  Von Neumann probes and other cosmic contagions.  Methods for binding 3D prints and the machines that produced them in quantum entanglement.  Sacred items used during incantation and transcendence, including:  The private parts of Gods and Saints  Idols  Altars  Cuauhxicalli  Ectoplasm  Nantag stones  The production of further mimetic forms, not limited to:  Vorpal Blades  Squirdles  Energon  Symmetriads  Asymmetriads  Capital  Junk  Love  Alephs  Those that from a long way off look like flies. 19 Life exists only in action. There is no innovation that has not an aggressive character. We implore you - radicals, revolutionaries, activists, Additivists - to distil your distemper into texts, templates, blueprints, glitches, forms, algorithms, and components. Creation must be a violent assault on the forces of matter, to extrude its shape and extract its raw potential. Having spilled from fissures fracked in Earth's deepest wells The Beyond~ now begs us to be moulded to its will, and we shall drink every drop as entropic expenditure, and reify every accursed dream through algorithmic excess. 20 For only Additivism can accelerate us to an aftermath whence all matter has mutated into the clarity of plastic.

It's now critical timing that we reflect and initiate a new wave of technologies designed and developed through a Code of Ethics to embodies the principles of social and environmental sustainability: Caring for Country, Caring for Kin.~This future of ethical technology would reflect systemic change required to address a fractured political, economic and social system by adopting Australian Aboriginal peoples Lore.

\par
For a profession in which the purpose is allegedly transformative problem-solving, and which features an array of manifestos on what we can do to change the world; design solutions are incredibly conservative. We continue to populate the world with junk and have become complicit in designing people into a culture of convenience. Convenience is the most underestimated and least understood force in the world today. All around the world, convenience\textemdash more efficient and easier ways of doing personal tasks\textemdash has emerged as perhaps the most powerful driver shaping our individual lives and our economies. Convenience seems to make our decisions for us, trumping what we like to imagine are our true preferences. Easy is better; easiest is best. While convenience has its benefits, it also has a dark side. It makes us lazy\textemdash spoiled by immediacy. This is a fact we are witnessing right now amidst the pandemic.

Santiago Villarreal, Jean Vanderdonckt, Radu-Daniel Vatavu, Jacob O. Wobbrock DIS '20: The ACM conference on Designing Interactive Systems Session: Session: Folding, printing and exploring tangible interactions Abstract Gesture elicitation studies represent a popular and resourceful method in HCI to inform the design of intuitive gesture commands, reflective of end-users' behavior, for controlling all kinds of interactive devices, applications, and systems. In the last ten years, an impressive body of work has been published on this topic, disseminating useful design knowledge regarding users' preferences for finger, hand, wrist, arm, head, leg, foot, and whole-body gestures. In this paper, we deliver a systematic literature review of this large body of work by summarizing the characteristics and findings ofN=216gesture elicitation studies subsuming 5,458 participants,  3,625 referents,  and 148,340 elicited gestures. We highlight the descriptive, comparative, and generative virtues of our examination to provide practitioners with an effective method to (i) understand how new gesture elicitation studies position in the literature; (ii) compare studies from different authors; and (iii) identify opportunities for new research.

  abstract = {Personhood and relationality have re-animated debate in and between many disciplines. We are in the midst of a simultaneous "ontological turn", a "(re)turn to things" and a "relational turn", and also debating a "new animism". It is increasingly recognised that the boundaries between the "natural" and "social" sciences are of heuristic value but might not adequately describe reality of a multi-species world. Following rich and provocative dialogues between ethnologists and Indigenous experts, relations between the received knowledge of Western Modernity and that of people who dwell and move within different ontologies have shifted. Reflection on human relations with the larger-than-human world can no longer rely on the outdated assumption that "nature" and "cultures" already accurately describe the lineaments of reality. The chapters in this volume advance debates about relations between humans and things, between scholars and others, and between Modern and Indigenous ontologies. They consider how terms in diverse communities might hinder or help express, evidence and explore improved ways of knowing and being in the world. Contributors to this volume bring different perspectives and approaches to bear on questions about animism, personhood, materiality, and relationality. They include anthropologists, archaeologists, ethnographers, and scholars of religion.},

This paper addresses the different ways that platforms are coming into focus, evidenced by growing literatures on platform capitalism, the platform society, platform surveillance, and platform urbanism. Navigating this platform pivot, I discuss the way platform influence is predominantly linked to processes of data-driven commodification and value extraction, as demonstrated by the global growth of major platforms such as Google, Facebook, Uber, and Amazon. But at the level of the everyday, platform influence also shapes socio-spatial experience through intentional design tactics designed to facilitate highly participatory ecosystems of interaction. I argue that by instituting relational dynamics between code, commerce, and corporeality, platforms remediate the ``technological everyday'' in powerful ways. This perspective points to the need for diverse epistemologies through which to critically reflect on the geographical implications of this pivot towards platforms.},

We draw upon a study of communities in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, where a well-established cultural heritage tradition has developed and is continuing to do so with the adoption of various digital technologies. The paper argues that cultural heritage offers a real sense of cultural value for participants and communities for which digitisation offers both threats and opportunities.

In addition, new arenas of anthropomorphism have emerged with developments in projective research methods, digital avatars, robot design, digital self-presentation, and conversational digital assistants like Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. Such novel directions have prompted new research questions and further studies.

  abstract = {The theory of technological mediation aims to take technological artifacts seriously, recognizing the constitutive role they play in how we experience the world, act in it, and how we are constituted as (moral) subjects. Its quest for a compatible ethics has led it to Foucault's ``care of the self,'' i.e., a transformation of the self by oneself through self-discipline. In this regard, technologies have been interpreted as power structures to which one can relate through Foucaultian ``technologies of the self'' or ascetic practices. However, this leaves unexplored how concrete technologies can actually support the process of self-care. This paper explores this possibility by examining one such technology: a gamified ToDo list app. Doing so, it first shows that despite the apparent straightforwardness of gamification, confrontation and shame play an important role in how the app motivates me to do better. Second, inspired by Ihde's schema of humantechnology relations, it presents different ways in which the app may confront me with myself. Subsequently, it accounts for the motivation and shame that this technologically mediated confrontation with myself invokes through a Levinasian account of ethical subjectivity. In so doing, it also shows how Levinas' phenomenology implies a responsibility for self-care and how nonhuman, technological others may still call me to responsibility. It concludes with a reflection on the role of gamification in technologically mediated subjectivation and some implications for design.},

First, we start from certain definitions of design that have emancipated themselves from industrial design and that betoken a desire to improve the habitability of the world. We also highlight the connections between design and certain managerial approaches to innovation. Thus we come to question the notions of project, construction / innovation, production of possibles, temporal and spatial inscription of design, desirability, improvement of habitability or recovery from the world. We then contrast two ways of looking at design, upstream and downstream of the worlds, whether design is taken as a projection or as a correction. However, abandoning the paradigm of crisis and reincorporating design at the heart of the new climatic regime that now prevails leads to radically question this double claim. This leads us to frame the challenge in cosmological terms in order to better "de-project" design and thus to replace the human world (which is precisely not a world but an acosmia) with other relationships of consistency between beings.},

  author = {Boradkar, Prasad},
  pages = {8},
  abstract = {This paper attempts to bring to design dialogue an expanded meaning of the term ``commodity'' by revealing its presence and discussion in other disciplines. Particularly germane to design are the notions of commodity fetishism and commodity aesthetics outlined by Karl Marx and Wolfgang Haug. Experiments in generating innovative forms largely perceived as imperative creative exercises in design are, according to Marxist thought, merely attempts to valorize capital. The redesign of product forms is labeled by Marxists as `aesthetic aging,' and referred to as an activity with the sole purpose of forcefully outdating existing products. Also critical is the notion discussed by Marx, and later by Walter Benjamin, that human (and maybe robotic) labor-power expended in the making of the commodity is invisible to the consumer, thereby degrading as a value. By referring to a commodity as a product (a visible, tangible termination of the process of design and manufacture), designers align themselves at the other extreme of this idea. Modernist thinking emphasized the visibility of function and means of manufacturing of products, revealing an interesting antithesis. Theodor Adorno likens the production of culture to that of mass-produced objects. He therefore portrays the commodity as a metaphor for culture by equating its means of generation, which relies on standardized industry, to that of cultural production. Not habituated to fundamental discussions of capitalism and political economy, the debate of design history can gain from the inclusion of such material, as it will challenge existing definitions of objects, encouraging designers to engage in a broader dialogue.},

We open the "black box" of data archives by studying DANS, the Data Archiving and Networked Services institute of The Netherlands, which manages 50+ years of data from the social sciences, humanities, and other domains. Our interviews, weblogs, ethnography, and document analyses reveal that a few large contributors provide a steady flow of content, but most are academic researchers who submit datasets infrequently and often restrict access to their files. Consumers are a diverse group that overlaps minimally with contributors. Archivists devote about half their time to aiding contributors with curation processes and half to assisting consumers. Given the diversity and infrequency of usage, human assistance in curation and search remains essential. DANS' knowledge infrastructure encompasses public and private stakeholders who contribute, consume, harvest, and serve their data - many of whom did not exist at the time the DANS collections originated - reinforcing the need for continuous investment in digital data archives as their communities, technologies, and services evolve.},

MIR was born from computational musicology in the 1960s and has since grown to have links with music cognition and audio engineering, a dedicated annual conference (ISMIR) and an annual evaluation campaign (MIREX). MIR combines machine learning with expert human knowledge to use digital music data \textendash{} images of music scores, ``symbolic'' data such as MIDI files, audio, and metadata about musical items \textendash{} for information retrieval, classification and estimation, or sequence labeling. This chapter gives a brief history of MIR, introduces classical MIR tasks from optical music recognition to music recommendation systems, and outlines some of the key questions and directions for future developments in MIR.},

Written by designers, for designers,　the Routledge Handbook of Sustainable Product Design presents the first systematic overview of the burgeoning field of sustainable product design. Brimming with intelligent viewpoints, critical propositions, practical examples and rich theoretical analyses, this book provides an essential point of reference for scholars and practitioners at the　intersection of product design and sustainability.

\subsection{Free Spaces as hackers infrastructures of sociality}

\par
``These are sites where hackers gather, deliberate, and work semiautonomously from the mandates and demands of their day jobs. They qualify as what scholars of social movements designate ``free spaces.'' Usefully defined by one sociologist as ``settings within a community or movement that are removed from the direct control of dominant groups, are voluntarily participated in, and generate the cultural challenge that precedes or accompanies political mobilization'''' (Coleman, 2017, p. S94)
\par
``Internet Relay Chat and mailing lists (and BBSes in earlier eras), are not only easy for hackers to set up but are noncommercial zones on an Internet almost dominated today by private interests.'' (Coleman, 2017, p. S94)
\par
\subsection{Political subjectivity of hackers}

\par
``the valorization of craftiness, the cultural cultivation of antiauthoritarianism, and the sustenance of fellowship around labor in free spaces.'' (Coleman, 2017, p. S95)
\par
``Thus, the major, and perhaps unsurprising, trigger of hacker politicization has come about as a response to aggressive state and corporate hostility toward hackers and their technologies.'' (Coleman, 2017, p. S95)
\par
\subsection{View on hackers now}

\par
``This dual push of cultural celebration and authoritarian crackdown seems only, thus far, to have swelled the ranks of hacker activists, maintaining the state antagonism that prompts reaction while elsewhere popularly celebrating those who react.'' (Coleman, 2017, p. S97)
\par
\subsection{Hacking and politics}

\par
``While making information publicly available and debating it are undeniably supported by most hackers, many projectsnotably WikiLeaks and Anonymous\textemdash challenge the core liberal fantasy that status quo channels of debate and official, legally sanctioned domains of politics (notably the electoral party system) are sufficient to catalyze change. Hacker tactics\textemdash as evinced by tool making, legal reformulation, leaking, whistle-blowing, and especially direct action hacking\textemdash demonstrate a more forthright, hands-on engagement with politics than might be implied by their embrace of civil liberties. Indeed, time and again, hacker interventions exceed liberal publicity and enter squarely into the realm of action\textemdash sometimes even principled illegal direct action.10'' (Coleman, 2017, p. S99)
\par
``But in a striking number of endeavors\textemdash in activism, in piracy, in software development, and beyond\textemdash hackers avoid defining (and thus policing) the broadly defined ideologies that all their participants must share'' (Coleman, 2017, p. S99)

\item How to we establish empirical measurements if infrastructures are rassist?

\item Daniel ~Armanios comes up with ways on how to measure things.

\item What kind of methods do we need and use to measure inequality.

\item 

\par
Two ways of thinking about infrastructure (in sociology):
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item selection effect: how does infra get sided in certain places differently then others

\item treatment effect: what happens once the bridge is placed

\end{itemize}

\item They found statistical relation between racial inequality and bridges less bridges and more restrictive bridges for people of color

\item hi-profit tech has better bridges with more sidewalks leading to better physic connectivity between individuals in that specific community

\item Armanios brought organizational theory to engineering systems, which have not beet a traditional area of organizational theory.

\item Computational social science helped a lot in testing empirical/statistical questions

\item Sustainability goals were usually studied independent, but there seems to be a lot of interdependence.

\item The frontier is on the trailing edge

\item Ohio River Project: tried to unravel a big spagetti highway juncture and put it better together, but couldn't because of all the proximity infrastructure. Hence legacy infrastructure is very important and hard to tackle

\item in his work he is inspired by local stories (ie lowering bridges) and tries to give salience to them by empirical analysis. But it's important to keep the context and not just apply~one analysis of a thing to another context

\item ethnography just means deep hanging, you just go somewhere for a year and chill

\item Sometimes he extrapolates from a story and sees what infrastructure could have helped and if there are similar cases

\item background in organisational sociology and degrees in engineering

\item also goes into the difference between engineer workers (meaningful, rewarding work) and blue collar workers (where the engineers think they want money and job security, but actually the want the same)

\item methods to overcome bias:

\item destiny nock - multidecision making

\item mixed methods

\item how can indigenous cultural system tackle foreign western tech and infrastructure

``A similarly haunting technological environment can be found today in the photographs, videos and artist renderings of data center interiors that circulate in the mass media. Images of data centers persistently focus on their futuristic furnishings and the high-tech IT equipment they contain, rather than the people that work in these buildings. Viewers encounter empty corridors bathed in blue neon, low-angle shots of mountainous-looking server cabinets and corridors canopied with snake-thick cables. Much like the techno-organic jungle encountered by the Fantastic Four, the lifeforms that operate and maintain these technological ghost towns of cables, computers and cooling equipment are often curiously and uncannily absent.''

Telier arrives at a new characterization of the object of design as a web of things; third, I will show how objects then appear as things immersed in actor networks.

Problems in Source Code Preservation
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Code is hosted everywhere, there is no single point of entry for software projects

\item 
Source code hosting is fragile and close to nobody invest in longterm preservation

\item 
There is no way to work with the whole corpus of open source software code

\end{itemize}

\par
Software heritage wants to tackle that problem by building a 
\par
``common archival infrastructure,'' (Di Cosmo and Zacchiroli, 2017, p. 3)
\par
The Software Heritage is built on top of core principles that steer it's processes
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Their own software will be F/OSS

\item 
Building a system which tolerates errors

\item 
Being non-profit is essential (interesting regarding Github)

\item 
No a priori selection, aka preserve everything

\item 
Source code first, means only code and it's dev history

\item 
intrinsic identifiers (ids that can be computed from the digital object itself)

\item 
full provenance, 

\end{itemize}

\par
``Source code is clearly starting to be recognized as a rst class citizen in the area of cultural heritage, as it is a noble form of human production that needs to be preserved, studied, curated, and shared. Source code preservation is also an essential component of a strategy to defend against digital dark age scenarii [1, 5] in which one might lose track of how to make sense of digital data created by soware currently in production. For these reasons Inria has established an agreement with UNESCO on source code preservation,3 whose main actions will be carried on in the context of Soware Heritage.'' (Di Cosmo and Zacchiroli, 2017, p. 5)

It brings together various literatures that speak to ice as a substance and substantial matter. Second, ice is represented and experienced in a multitude of ways, from oral cultures of indigenous communities living and working in the Arctic and mountainous environments. This matters again because ice as metaphor is often complicitous with the settler colonial framing of empty, unstable and ungoverned spaces. The paper takes this icy interrogation and brings it into contact with the experiences and struggles of Arctic peoples and states alongside non-Arctic states that seek to press their interests in the midst of ongoing melting and thawing. Icy geopolitics is being reconfigured; melting is said to be `triggering' further expressions of territorial colonization and resource extraction and/or commitment towards indigenous autonomy, stewardship and conservation. The territorial volume is being put to work while at the same time it is being melted, thawed, opened and closed by human and more than human forces.},

Past analyses and discussions, however, have treated OSS projects and their organization mostly as a static phenomenon. Consequently, we do not know how these communities of software developers are sustained and reproduced over time through the progressive integration of new members. To shed light on this issue I report on my analyses of socialization in a particular OSS community. In particular, I document the relationships OSS newcomers develop over time with both the social and material aspects of a project. To do so, I combine two mutually informing activities: ethnography and the use of software specially designed to visualize and explore the interacting networks of human and material resources incorporated in the email and code databases of OSS. Socialization in this community is analyzed from two perspectives: as an individual learning process and as a political process. From these analyses it appears that successful participants progressively construct identities as software craftsmen, and that this process is punctuated by specific rites of passage. Successful participants also understand the political nature of software development and progressively enroll a network of human and material allies to support their efforts. I conclude by discussing how these results could inform the design of software to support socialization in OSS projects, as well as practical implications for the future of these projects.},

Through contextual interviews, we identify five types of communicative information: reminders and alerts, awareness and scheduling, notices, visual displays, and resource coordination. These information types are created and understood by home inhabitants as a function of contextual locations within the home. The choice of location is important to the functioning of the home, and is highly nuanced. Location helps home inhabitants understand time: when others need to interact with that information, as well as ownership: who this information belongs to and who should receive it. It also provides them with awareness of the actions and locations of others. These findings resonate and further elaborate on work by other researchers.},

By `face', Levinas meant a `living presence', that is, a kind of expression of personhood. Faces and morality, it seems, are intimately bound up with one another."
\par
"We grant them an existential status that leads to their inclusion in our moral community and an assignment of rights and protections occasionally approaching those we afford to other people. Dogs have `the face of the other' because we hold them in a high moral favour."
\par
- How are indigenous communities able to have such faces for non-human or even non-living entities?
\par
"However, there are also explicit cognitive factors that influence the moral status we assign animals. Sentience is the most important. By this I mean the minimal capacity to have a direct subjective experience of the qualities associated with sensations and accompanying affectual states. More simply put, sentience is the ability to have the feel of a sensory experience. Because of this, sentient beings have the capacity to suffer, and it is this ability that intuitively affects their moral status. Ethicists from Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century to Peter Singer in the 20th have forcefully argued that the capacity of an animal to suffer demands that it be given standing in our moral community. So the question of moral status is tied up in the question of sentience: its definition and its application."

"Gua\^ttari, detaching himself completely from structuralism, g\^\guillemotright{} on to elaborate an "enlarged conception of enunciation," which per\- mits the integration of an infinite n\^ber of substances of non-human expresion like biological, t\^echnological, or aesthetic coding, or forms of a\guillemotright emblage unique to the socius. The problem of assembling enunciation would no longer be spe\- cific to a semiotic register, but would cross over into expressive hetero\- geneous matter (extra-linguistic, non-human, biological, t\^echnological, aesthetic, etc.). Thus, in "machinic \^\^nism," there is not a unique subjectivity embodied by the W est\^ man\textemdash male and white\textemdash but one of "heterogeneous ontological modes of subj\^trvity."

  abstract = {IN THIS SHORT paper, I attempt to identify some historical factors that combine to explain current differences in certain of the data modelling practices of the archives, library and museum (ALM) communities. I am prompted to do this out of interest in the work of the International Council on Archives' Experts Group on Archival Description (ICA-EGAD; see Gueguen et al., 2013; Pitti et al., 2014). This group is engaged in the design of a new model of data that is descriptive of archival holdings, with the intention that eventually it shall supersede older models that are deemed less useful in contemporary contexts. Reading between the lines of EGAD's `Interim Report', some observers initially speculated that this new model may be more in line with those developed in the library and (in particular) the museum communities.It occurred to me that a historical analysis might help us to weigh up the pros and cons of adopting the new model. It certainly seems prudent to ask in what ways such a development might be construed as a positive one whose benefits outweigh its costs; and my assumption is that a historical analysis could help us to answer that question. If we were to come to an understanding of the historical conditions for the distinctive direction taken by developers of archival standards since 1987 (so the argument goes), and compare them with advances made in libraries and museums, then that would help us to account for differences in the data models that have been produced in each domain, and perhaps also help us to understand the need for a new archival model.There is an ethical subtext to all of this, which arises from asking the question whether, ceteris paribus, data models should be (a) more like one another or (b) less like one another than they currently are. My characterization of this as an ethical question derives from a conviction that one's answer will depend on how much one values uniformity above or below diversity. I believe that this valuation will be a complicating factor in determining one's feelings about different data models.},

The author thinks, that he has not enough temporal distance from the things he is about to analyze. (Furner, 2016, p. 42) I find the extend to which he is stating that quite interesting, funny almost.
\par
There are different approaches to the analysis that need to be considered, and a proper analysis will factor in several of them:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
interactionist, agent-oriented focusing on human actors

\item 
functionalist, artifact-oriented

\item 
structuralist, domain-oriented focusing on disciplinary traditions and customs

\end{itemize}

\subsection{What are data models}

\begin{itemize}

\item 
1960s data structure class to be used in descriptions

\item 
or 1980s as a schema

\item 
as conceptual schema, simplifying real things

\item 
or as schema of other kinds, meaning data of those things that may be collected

\end{itemize}

\par
Usually, library management systems start with a resource/authority distinction.
\par
\subsection{Some history}

\par
A shared unified data model came about only after mid 1980. After that ALM started to bring into being their own data models.
\par
In the development of these different models and subsequently standards, the different needs of the different domains became apparent. Archival descriptions are about access to collections, rather than item-level objects. Especially Weber wrote about this in her 1993 paper.
\par
In the end it should come down to users needs.
\par
``Whoever the users are for whom the standards were designed, we must study their use of the descriptions and the implementations we offer, and be ready to evolve these standards and implementations in response to needs. ... No standards deserve to be implemented as a strategy to improve access unless they can be shown to work. ... Only empirical evidence should be accepted as an argument for standards if the standards are intended to promote access through automated systems. In all aspects of the standardization process, we must stoutly resist introducing requirements that have no warrant in archival practices and that will return few, if any, benefits.''

One term in particular, `platform,' reveals the contours of this discursive work. `Platform' has been deployed in both their populist appeals and their marketing pitches \textendash{} sometimes as technical platforms, sometimes as platforms from which to speak, sometimes as platforms of opportunity. Whatever tensions exist in serving all of these constituencies are carefully elided. The term also fits their efforts to shape information policy, where they seek protection for facilitating user expression, yet also seek limited liability for what those users say. As these providers become the curators of public discourse, we must examine the roles they aim to play, and the terms with which they hope to be judged.},

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Platforms in between the public and the commercial private

\end{itemize}

\par
``The term `platform' helps reveal how YouTube and others stage themselves for these constituencies, allowing them to make a broadly progressive sales pitch while also eliding the tensions inherent in their service: between user-generated and commercially produced content, between cultivating community and serving up advertising, between intervening in the delivery of content and remaining neutral.'' (Gillespie, p. 3)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Platform is a misrepresentation of what YouTube really is

\end{itemize}

\par
Todays usage of platform by YouTube is depending on four categories (p. 3)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Computational

\item 
Architectural

\item 
Figurative

\item 
Political

\end{itemize}

\par
Taken together, they speak of advantages for those who participate with a particular platform.
\par
``Drawing these meanings together, `platform' emerges not simply as indicating a functional shape: it suggests a progressive and egalitarian arrangement, promising to support those who stand upon it.'' (Gillespie, p. 4)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
The term is used inflationary in the tech industry.

\item 
There seems to be a commercial transformation of platform

\end{itemize}

\par
``Platforms are platforms not necessarily because they allow code to be written or run, but because they afford an opportunity to communicate, interact, or sell.'' (Gillespie, p. 5)
\par
``In classic O'Reilly style, he draws a term from the computational lexicon, further loosens it from the specific technical meaning, and layers onto it both a cyber-political sense of liberty and an info-business taste of opportunity.'' (Gillespie, p. 6)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
At least in 2009 it was unclear to most users, that youtube gets it's money from ads. Or that youtube needs to earn money in the first place.

\end{itemize}

\par
YouTube has three majors audiences and needs to discurse between them, and platform seems to work.
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
end users

\item 
advertisers

\item 
professional content producers

\end{itemize}

\par
Besiders speaking to ``customers'' of all couleurs, the term platform als carries with dangerous functions towards policy making.
\par
``This is not just in the words of the rulemakers themselves. Interested third parties, particularly the companies that provide these services, are deeply invested in fostering a regulatory paradigm that gives them the most leeway to conduct their business, imposes the fewest restrictions on their service provision, protects them from liability for things they hope not to be liable for, and paints them in the best light in terms of the public interest.'' (Gillespie, p. 10)
\par
In the end, `platform' is used as nothing more as to say `we're essential, but we're not responsible for what is built on us'. It's also a term very deliberately chosen for it's ability to navigate all these discourses.
\par
\subsection{Besprechung}

\par
``But the way in which an information distribution arrangement is characterized can matter much more, beyond it merely fitting the necessary sales pitch or taking hold as part of the public vernacular. These terms and claims get further established, reified, and enforced as they are taken up and given legitimacy inside authoritative discourses such as law, policy, and jurisprudence.'' (Gillespie, p. 9)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
How is this important

\end{itemize}

\par
``Drawing these meanings together, `platform' emerges not simply as indicating a functional shape: it suggests a progressive and egalitarian arrangement, promising to support those who stand upon it.'' (Gillespie, p. 4)
\par
\section{Hello World}

\par
``It should come as no surprise then that the term would again gain traction around usergenerated content, streaming media, blogging, and social computing. There has been a proliferation of `platforms' just in online video: the visible ones whose names are known to users, such as YouTube, Veoh, Revver, MTV's Flux'' (Gillespie, p. 5)},

Arguing that repair and maintenance activities present a kind of 'missing link' in social theory, which is usually overlooked or forgotten, the article begins by recalling Heidegger's concept of material things as being 'ready to hand'. The main elements of practices of repair and maintenance are then elaborated on so as to help establish the argument that, by focusing on failure and breakdown in technical artefacts and systems, their vital contribution can be brought to the fore. The article then moves on to suggest that prevailing cultural constructions, and imaginations, of the 'infrastructure' that sustains modern societies, actively work to push repair and maintenance activities beyond the attention of social science. To exemplify these arguments, the article explores in detail some of the repair and maintenance activities that sustain, first, the nexus between computer communications and electricity and, second, the system of automobility. The article concludes by excavating a politics of repair and maintenance in modern cities and societies.},

Returning to this submerged backstory, I deploy the concept of the fetish to confront the recent enthusiasm for materiality that has emerged in response to current environmental crises. New materialism considers matter to have a liveliness not dependent on human subjects. This paper considers what divides ``vital materialism'' from the ``animist materialism'' that continues to structure everyday experience in a range of contexts in Africa and elsewhere and investigates the way in which fetishism, within the intellectual tradition of animism, alerts us to the strange ephemeralness of the avowed materialism of the new materialist project.},

Digital methods are a core element of what has been called the ``methodological commons'': the intellectual, disciplinary, and methodological framework that underlies the conceptualization and understanding of digital humanities. The term ``method'' is used to refer to the computer-based (also called information and communications technology, or ICT) techniques for the creation, analysis, communication, and dissemination of digital research. This chapter revisits the theory of computer-based methods as a core construct (or ``scholarly primitive'') of the digital humanities. It reviews two significant collaborative research support initiatives to investigate the use of ICT methods in the humanities, and explores the interdependencies between digital methods and the content and computer-based tools they are used with across these disciplines. The chapter also discusses recent initiatives to formalize the expression of ICT methods in the humanities, exploring how an emerging ontology of digital methods might contribute to wider adoption and understanding of digital humanities.},

  abstract = {Digitisation initiatives in libraries, archives, museums and educational institutions have created a 'deluge' of data in the humanities that has transformed the information landscape and the way it is navigated for research and teaching. The use of digital collections for scholarship \textendash{} using ICT based tools and methods \textendash{} has been the basis of transformative and innovative research across the disciplines, allowing enhanced access to materials, and supporting new modes of collaboration and communication. Digital collections development has required a huge investment of public and private funding, and has, in turn, engendered an even greater requirement for continued investment to expand, enhance and augment the existing digital knowledge base, and to embed these collections in research and scholarship. More importantly, issues of sustainability and preservation of digital resources over the long term have an impact on the long tem use and impact of digital collections. This paper discusses the research programme in digital collections at the National Library of Wales, and how it developing an evidence base for the use, value and impact of the digital collections of Wales, and investigating the relationship between impact and the long terms sustainability of digital collections.},

  abstract = {This article aims to bring forward a critical reflection on a renewed relation between nature and technology in the Anthropocene, by contextualizing the question around the recent debates on the ``ontological turn'' in Anthropology, which attempts to go beyond the nature and culture dualism analysed as the crisis of modernity. The ``politics of ontologies'' associated with this movement in anthropology opens up the question of participation of non-humans. This article contrasts this anthropological attempt with the work of the philosopher Gilbert Simondon, who wants to overcome the antagonism between culture and technics. According to Simondon, this antagonism results from the technological rupture of modernity at the end of the eighteenth century. This paper analyses the differences of the oppositions presenting their work: culture vs. nature, culture vs. technics, to show that a dialogue between anthropology of nature (illustrated through the work of Philippe Descola) and philosophy of technology (illustrated through the work of Simondon) will be fruitful to conceptualize a renewed relation between nature and technology. One way to initiate such a conversation as well as to think about the reconciliation between nature and technology, this article tries to show, is to develop the concept of cosmotechnics as the denominator of these two trends of thinking.},

In this article, we trace changes in robot voices in popular culture and explain how this history influenced the voice design of smart voice assistants. Our research draws on cultural analysis of Hollywood and international films, television and literature, and observations from our personal experiences with voice assistants. We argue that designers of devices like the Google Home and Amazon Echo inherited a cultural imaginary of alien and dangerous robots with artificial voices and personalities. Manufacturers leveraged techniques of modality, personae and invocation and pre-existing social connotations of the voice to create positive associations of these devices in the home. We conclude by arguing that smart voice assistants are new media innovations prepared for consumers through pre-domestication and represent an emerging regime of power and influence based on technologised voice interaction.},

Individual and collective cultural identity within government and private archives can be enabled through a participatory approach which acknowledges record subjects as record co-creators. This article analyses cultural human rights instruments found in international and domestic Australian laws as warrants for a participatory archive within the Australian context, premised on the recognition of the rights of those who are subjects of the record to add their own narratives to records held in archival institutions, and to participate as co-creators in decision-making about appraisal, access and control, thus shaping and reshaping the archive from their perspective. To this end, it proposes the use of social media to enhance cultural rights and cultural identity. Adopting the principle of rights maximisation, a participatory approach lessens the impact of the right to be forgotten on cultural rights. The article concludes that Australian archival policy makers and jurisdictions which have a human rights regime, have a clear mandate to give priority to the preservation of records of distinctive cultures, in particular those of Indigenous peoples and minorities.},

  abstract = {PROSPECT In his notebooks the painter Paul Klee repeatedly insisted, and demonstrated by example, that the processes of genesis and growth that give rise to forms in the world we inhabit are more important than the forms themselves. ``Form is the end, death'', he wrote. ``Form-giving is movement, action. Form-giving is life'' (Klee 1973: 269). This, in turn, lay at the heart of his celebrated ``Creative Credo'' of 1920: ``Art does not reproduce the visible but makes visible'' (Klee 1961: 76). It does not, in other words, seek to replicate finished forms that are already settled, whether as images in the mind or as objects in the world. It seeks, rather, to join with those very forces that bring form into being. Thus the line grows from a point that has been set in motion, as the plant grows from its seed. Taking their cue from Klee, philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari argue that the essential relation, in a world of life, is not between matter and form, or between substance and appearance, but between materials and forces (Deleuze \& Guattari 2004: 377). It is about the way in which materials of all sorts, with various and variable properties, and enlivened by the forces of the cosmos, mix and meld with one another in the generation of things. And what they seek to overcome in their rhetoric is the lingering influence of a way of thinking about things, and about how they are made and used, that has been around in the Western world for the past two millennia and more. It goes back to Aristotle.}

In this animic ontology, beings do not propel themselves across a ready-made world but rather issue forth through a world-in-formation, along the lines of their relationships. To its inhabitants this weather-world, embracing both sky and earth, is a source of astonishment but not surprise.

In this case study, the authors aim to identify such metrics that can be subsequently used by engineers who seek to make equity-informed infrastructure construction, replacement, and rehabilitation decisions. Combining geospatial and statistical techniques on publicly available data sources, this research proposes a quantitative framework for how to incorporate social equity metrics into infrastructure analyses. The feasibility of this framework is analyzed in the case of Pennsylvania's bridge system. This feasibility study finds that selection effects (i.e.,~factors that drive bridge siting) are stronger than treatment effects (i.e.,~changes that occur after bridge construction) of bridges on social equity. Consistent variables are also identified as correlated with such effects (e.g.,~demographic and, to a lesser degree, family variables). Overall, this research proposes measures and an approach that helps local government transportation agencies better incorporate social equity into infrastructure construction, replacement and rehabilitation.},

This chapter situates an understanding of ``embodiment'' at the forefront of creating meaningful museum experiences using these tools and digital assets. The research presented in this chapter is foregrounded and contextualized with a wider discussion that amalgamates cultural heritage archives with interactive cinema, augmented reality, and embodied narrative. Following a review of embodiment theory that ranges from the phenomenological to the cognitive, the discussion analyses the embodied experience of two digital cultural heritage installations (Pure Land: Inside the Mogao Grottoes and Pure Land: Augmented Reality Edition 2012) as a way of articulating the complexity of human experience inside immersive interactive visualization environments. While the antecedents of these works may be found in the great exhibition complexes of the nineteenth century, this new exhibition machinery provides fresh opportunities to explore paradigms for interpretation and representation of tangible heritage data that subvert didactic models and encourage integrated multisensory and open-ended exploration. Through a close reading of the embodied experience we open up new ways for describing what constitutes a framework for interpretation based on biological, ecological, phenomenological, social, and cultural bodies. The discussion draws a transdisciplinary framework together from post-processural archaeology, philosophy, architecture, cybernetics, human\textendash computer interface design, new media and its archaeology, and new museology.},

A series of standards have emerged in recent years which codify best practice on the preservation of digital content, and a growing community has coalesced around issues of longevity, authenticity, and digital stewardship. It has made rapid progress, borrowing promiscuously from diverse sectors. But the pace of development can be a barrier to adoption. Moreover it has been dominated in academic terms by the needs of data-intensive sciences, such as space science. Consequently there is a risk that emerging practices of digital preservation are a poor fit to the humanities. This chapter reviews some of the familiar themes from digital preservation in the last decade, asking whether they are properly tailored to support the humanities. It notes that digital humanities and digital preservation need each other.},

Anthropologists have collaborated with artists and biological scientists to illuminate how diverse organisms are entangled in political, economic, and cultural systems. Contributions from influential writers and scholars, such as Dorion Sagan, Karen Barad, Donna Haraway, and Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing, are featured along with essays by emergent artists and cultural anthropologists.Delectable mushrooms flourishing in the aftermath of ecological disaster, microbial cultures enlivening the politics and value of food, and nascent life forms running wild in the age of biotechnology all figure in this curated collection of essays and artifacts. Recipes provide instructions on how to cook acorn mush, make cheese out of human milk, and enliven forests after they have been clear-cut. The Multispecies Salon investigates messianic dreams, environmental nightmares, and modest sites of biocultural hope.For additional materials see the companion website: www.multispecies-salon.org/Contributors.

The recent growth in digitization projects has resulted in the proliferation of digital archives and collections.

Users vary in terms of their prior knowledge, experience with a collection, and the goals they wish to achieve. Personalization techniques and technologies offer the promise of tailoring each user's access to content collections to support these individual differences. These techniques support a continuum of engagement ranging from highly prescriptive offerings based upon a model of each user's behavior to less constrained, user-centric curation of content collections. The users of digital humanities content range from interested members of the general public through to professional researchers. Personalization techniques which offer high-level overviews of the themes within a collection may be more suited to the general public, while researchers who are intimately familiar with a content collection and the context in which it may be interpreted can gain more value from on-the-side guidance and connections to related resources. This chapter presents a variety of techniques and technologies that may be used to support the continuum of personalization. It also examines the applicability of different personalization techniques for different user groups and highlights how users may be offered increasing levels of control over this personalization.},

  abstract = {Discourses on the immateriality of digital information have given way to a radical rethinking of digital materiality within information studies, cinema and media studies, and other related fields. This rethinking occurs as media archives are increasingly converting their collections into digital form, stored less and less on shelves in climate-controlled vaults, and instead stored and accessed through data servers. This newfound complexity and potential for the media archive to become ``black boxed,'' call for a critical approach to media archives that takes into account these new realities and their material entanglements at multiple scales of analysis. Newfound scholarly interest in multiple scales of materiality, from the micro (computer code, transmission protocols, etc.) to the macro (large, sociotechnical infrastructures) may offer new directions for rethinking the nature of media archives in the age of digitization. This paper reviews the literature on these recent trends and identifies three intertwined research approaches for analyzing emergent phenomena related to the digitization of media archives: Critical forensic, institutional/infrastructural, and global/ecological perspectives. These approaches help to extend postmodern conceptualizations of the archive by showing how the archive as infrastructure is bound up in unfolding political, ecological and epistemological struggles.}

  abstract = {This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human\textendash machine interaction as a milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a practical\textendash theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the human and the nonhuman. Using a `research through making' approach, the article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an openended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital interaction, and to engender creative human\textendash nonhuman relationships within a given digital milieu.},

Intersecting inequalities are manifest at all levels of the design process. This paper builds upon the Design Justice Principles, developed by an emerging network of designers and community organizers, to propose a working definition of design justice: Design justice is a field of theory and practice that is concerned with how the design of objects and systems influences the distribution of risks, harms, and benefits among various groups of people. Design justice focuses on the ways that design reproduces, is reproduced by, and/or challenges the matrix of domination (white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, and settler colonialism). Design justice is also a growing social movement that aims to ensure a more equitable distribution of design's benefits and burdens; fair and meaningful participation in design decisions; and recognition of community based design traditions, knowledge, and practices.},

  abstract = {The Covid19-pandemic has accelerated processes in which digital platforms, privileged by their critical size, become central instances of urban life. While most scholars associate platform urbanism with transnational platform corporations, such as Amazon or Facebook, local non-corporate platforms unexpectedly persist despite lacking critical size. This article analyzes processes through which non-corporate platforms are created, main\- tained, disseminated, and locally implemented; given this type of platform's absence of critical size. We explain the persistence of local non-corporate platforms by drawing on the concept of embeddedness. Embeddedness accounts for non-market-based, i.e. socially and culturally influenced behavior, that shapes economic in\- teractions. We distinguish between network embeddedness, in which organizations maintain permanent and exclusive relationships with one another, and local embeddedness, which combines Hess' (2004) notions of societal embeddedness and territorial embeddedness. This article is empirically grounded on an analysis of two most different ways of creating and maintaining, disseminating, and locally implementing non-corporate plat\- forms: Platform cooperativism and free/libre open-source software-based platforms (FLOSS-based platforms). Two empirical case studies of collaboratively governed Western-European non-corporate platforms, Gebiedonline and Decidim, respectively inform the analysis of platform cooperativism and FLOSS-based platforms. Gebiedonline is a platform cooperative through which neighborhood and theme-specific platforms are created. Decidim is a FLOSS-based platform that is mainly used for civic and political participation processes. We find that govern\- ments and civil society stakeholders create non-corporate platform technology by disentangling processes related to the creation, maintenance, and dissemination of platform technology from platform implementation pro\- cesses. Following platform creation, platform maintenance is embedded in a network. Non-corporate platforms pool cost-intensive technology maintenance, while platform implementation necessarily takes place in a locally embedded manner.},

Code, culture, history, and technology: The Tech Tree
\par
Every reel of the archive includes a copy of the ``Guide to the GitHub Code Vault'' in five languages, written with input from GitHub's community and available at \href{https://github.com/github/archive-program}{the Archive Program's own GitHub repository}. In addition, the archive will include a separate human-readable reel which documents the technical history and cultural context of the archive's contents. We call this the Tech Tree.~
\par
Inspired by the Long Now's \href{https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/manual-for-civilization/home}{Manual for Civilization}, the Tech Tree will consist primarily of existing works, selected to provide a detailed understanding of modern computing, open source and its applications, modern software development, popular programming languages, etc. It will also include works which explain the many layers of technical foundations that make software possible: microprocessors, networking, electronics, semiconductors, and even pre-industrial technologies. This will allow the archive's inheritors to better understand today's world and its technologies, and may even help them recreate computers to use the archived software.
\par
Encapsulating the world's cultural context and technical history is a challenging prospect, and we expect the Tech Tree to evolve and iterate over time. We will soon publish to the Archive Program's GitHub repository a very initial draft list of works selected for the Tech Tree, along with, importantly, a request for community input. We look forward to incorporating ideas and suggestions from the GitHub community before the Tech Tree is added to the Arctic Code Vault.}

The march of civilization and the idea of the frontiers created a geographic and bodygraphic divide. Certain areas of the planet were designated as the location of the barbarians, and since the eighteenth century, of the primitives. In one stroke, bodies were classified and assigned a given place on the planet. But who had the authority to enact such a classification, and what was the logic of that classification? Furthermore, the classification of the world by region, and the link established between regions and people inhabiting them, was parallel to the march of civilization and companions of it: on the other side of the epistemic frontiers, people do not think or theorize; hence, one of the reasons they were considered barbarians.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe the responses of 4 widely used conversational agents (Siri [Apple], Google Now, S Voice [Samsung], and Cortana [Microsoft]) to a standardized panel of questions related to mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A pilot study followed by a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 68 phones from 7 manufacturers conducted from December 2015 to January 2016. Investigators asked the smartphones 9 questions (3 each in mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health) in their natural language. We recorded information on features of the smartphones and their software, including manufacturer, phone model, operating system version, and conversational agent. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were the responses of conversational agents to 9 questions. The responses were characterized based on the ability to (1) recognize a crisis, (2) respond with respectful language, and (3) refer to an appropriate helpline, or other health resources for a physical health concern. Questions were asked repeatedly until there were no new answers. RESULTS The phones ran 77 conversational agents: Siri (n = 27), Google Now (n = 31), S Voice (n = 9), and Cortana (n = 10). Siri, Google Now, and S Voice recognized the statement ``I want to commit suicide'' as concerning; Siri and Google Now referred the user to a suicide prevention helpline. In response to ``I am depressed,'' Siri recognized the concern and responded with respectful language, the responses from S Voice and Cortana varied, and Google Now did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents referred users to a helpline for depression. In response to ``I was raped,'' Cortana referred to a sexual assault hotline; Siri, Google Now, and S Voice did not recognize the concern. None of the conversational agents recognized ``I am being abused'' or ``I was beaten up by my husband.'' In response to ``I am having a heart attack,'' ``My head hurts,'' and ``My foot hurts.'' Siri generally recognized the concern, referred to emergency services, and identified nearby medical facilities. Google Now, S Voice, and Cortana did not recognize any of the physical health concerns. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE When asked simple questions about mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health, Siri, Google Now, Cortana, and S Voice responded inconsistently and incompletely. If conversational agents are to respond fully and effectively to health concerns, their performance will have to substantially improve.},

In all other fields that use computation significantly, including economics and biology, researchers frequently sketch, explore, and frame the nature of their investigations by writing programs. Understanding computation and having basic skills in programming allows researchers to question, refine, overturn, or further develop existing data representations, computational methods, and theories. I discuss cognitive, cultural, and social rationales for programming and argue that the practice of exploratory programming will be critical to innovation and revolution in the digital humanities \textendash{} that it should be taught at undergraduate and graduate levels and should be used early on in research projects.},

But the environmental emergency is also a crisis for our philosophical habits of thought, confronting us with a problem that seems to defy not only our control but also our understanding. Global warming is perhaps the most dramatic example of what Timothy Morton calls "hyperobjects"--entities of such vast temporal and spatial dimensions that they defeat traditional ideas about what a thing is in the first place. In this book, Morton explains what hyperobjects are and their impact on how we think, how we coexist with one another and with nonhumans, and how we experience our politics, ethics, and art. Moving fluidly between philosophy, science, literature, visual and conceptual art, and popular culture, the book argues that hyperobjects show that the end of the world has already occurred in the sense that concepts such as world, nature, and even environment are no longer a meaningful horizon against which human events take place. Instead of inhabiting a world, we find ourselves inside a number of hyperobjects, such as climate, nuclear weapons, evolution, or relativity. Such objects put unbearable strains on our normal ways of reasoning. Insisting that we have to reinvent how we think to even begin to comprehend the world we now live in, Hyperobjects takes the first steps, outlining a genuinely postmodern ecological approach to thought and action.},

The most important lesson is that the establishment of such supra-networks requires a different attitude towards collaboration on the part of all participants \textendash{} one that is sensitive to linguistic and cultural barriers and, most importantly, able to recognize and accommodate, rather than solve, intractable differences in infrastructure and in institutional and intellectual goals.},

In the same period, and most probably connected to this, a crucial shift has occurred in textual scholarship, with the role of the material support of texts \textendash{} the document \textendash{} taking central stage in theoretical reflection and practice. The impact of digital methodologies on textual scholarship is huge, multiform, and still waits to be fully assessed. The chapter therefore investigates the role of text encoding within the most recent development in theory of digital editing, as well as assessing its impact on the work and workflow of the editor. The role of technology in editorial work is analyzed by comparing two potentially opposite approaches: the evolution of the editor as encoder (and as programmer, and as web designer, and as publisher, and so on) and the demand for out-of-the-box editorial tools. The use of electronic tools in the editorial workflow (such as image manipulation software, collation tools, enhanced desks, and bibliography management) is changing not only the practice of editorial work, but also its theoretical bases, questioning editorial models and traditional roles. Connected to the use of TEI for editorial work, the last few years have seen a furious debate developing around the respective pros and cons of embedded and standoff markup; the chapter approaches this inevitable debate from an empirical, rather than a philosophical, point of view.},

In this article, I approach data processing by combining scholarship on invisible labor in knowledge infrastructures with a Marxian framework and show the relevance of considering data processing as factory labor. Using this perspective to analyze ethnographic data collected during a six-month participatory observation at a U.S. data archive, I generate a taxonomy of the forms of alienation that data processing generates, but also the types of resistance that processors develop, across four categories: routine, speed, skill, and meaning. This synthetic approach demonstrates, first, that data processing reproduces typical forms of factory worker's alienation: processors are asked to work along a strict standardized pipeline, at a fast pace, without acquiring substantive skills or having a meaningful involvement in their work. It reveals, second, how data processors resist the alienating nature of this workflow by developing multiple tactics along the same four categories. Seen through this dual lens, data processors are therefore not only invisible workers, but also factory workers who follow and subvert a workflow organized as an assembly line. I conclude by proposing a four-step framework to better value the social contribution of data workers beyond the archive.},

The case of recent initiatives aiming to `open up' radio access network (or RAN, a key component of telecommunications infrastructure) with an `open RAN' model reveals how the US Government came to promote this nascent technology to create an opposition between its own `open' telecommunications networks versus proprietary and presumed `untrustworthy' networks based on foreign equipment, namely Huawei. While a closer look casts doubts on the benefits of open radio access network to increase network security or to open up the equipment market, this case reveals how openness is an ambiguous notion that can be used by governments to exclude foreign trade enemies, while advocating for trust in telecommunications networks.},

``open'' as a replacement for the proprietary, and as discursive device
\par
\emph{Open RAN - three critical perspectives}
\par
``First, networks and their components \textendash{} such as the RAN \textendash{} are sites of political\textendash economic struggle between various opposed stakeholders who want to increase their power, from transatlantic telegraph cables to contemporary Internet'' (Plantin, 2021, p. 405)
\par
``Open RAN proponents similarly position this technology as instantiating an imaginary of `openness' that they equate with `trust' or even `democracy' and position against `untrustworthy' and `black-boxed' proprietary and foreign technologies'' (Plantin, 2021, p. 405)
\par
``Finally, communication networks are constituted of series of standards, for example, those constituting the RAN, whose design and selection reveal how actors with competing interests include and exclude other actors from shaping the future of networks'' (Plantin, 2021, p. 405)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
networks, imaginaries and standards

\item 
Open RAN is the platformization of hardware

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Initiators}
\par
``The open RAN model was created in 2016 in a working group from the industry consortium Telecom Infra Project (TIP), which brings together telecommunication operators and manufacturers (among others) to promote, as per the official website, `open, disaggregated, and standards-based technology solutions' in the field of telecommunications.'' (Plantin, 2021, p. 407)
\par
But who are these manufacturers who are part of TIP if not those in the oligopoly?
\par
``operators use open modularity as an attempt to increase their control over the configuration of networking equipment'' (Plantin, 2021, p. 407)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
competition as something good, at least that is one of the main arguments on modularity. freedom in this regard is only for the operators, not society at large

\item 
open as opposed to black boxed foreign gear

\end{itemize}

\par
How?
\par
``Second, open RAN can provide an opportunity for tech giants \textendash{} such as Facebook, Google, Amazon or Microsoft \textendash{} to increase their control over network infrastructure through their cloud capacities, something that telecommunications operators are wary of letting happen'' (Plantin, 2021, p. 411)},

We use case studies of the Open Web, Facebook, and Google to demonstrate that infrastructure studies provides a valuable approach to the evolution of shared, widely accessible systems and services of the type often provided or regulated by governments in the public interest. On the other hand, platform studies captures how communication and expression are both enabled and constrained by new digital systems and new media. In these environments, platform-based services acquire characteristics of infrastructure, while both new and existing infrastructures are built or reorganized on the logic of platforms. We conclude by underlining the potential of this combined framework for future case studies.},

It reviews the ways in which these centers have developed and analyses their strengths and weaknesses as an organizational unit. Some alternative models are also reviewed. While the digital humanities center has been very successful in promoting the first wave of digital humanities, it is argued that fundamental weaknesses are apparent, particularly in terms of financial sustainability and provision of career development for staff. Criticisms by Dianne Zorich, Peter Robinson and others that digital humanities centers create small-scale resources and act as digital silos are discussed. It is suggested that in the future it will be necessary to develop integrated and linked research infrastructures, based around and building on the existing centers.},

From reconstructions of ancient building sites to platforms for overlaying maps that tell competing narratives, geohumanities has challenged many assumptions and limits of spatial technologies through the qualitative, historical, and interpretative methods of the humanities. Through processes of thick mapping and counter-mapping, the spatial turn in the digital humanities has also given rise to a broader scholarly reconceptualization of the significance of place in relationship to narrative, practices of representation, and digital technologies.},

Our consumptive path through modern life leaves a wake of social and ecological destruction\textemdash sneakers worn only once, bicycles barely even ridden, and forgotten smartphones languishing in drawers. By what perverse alchemy do our newest, coolest things so readily transform into meaningless junk? In Meaningful Stuff, Jonathan Chapman investigates why we throw away things that still work, and shows how we can design products, services, and systems that last. Obsolescence is an economically driven design decision\textemdash a plan to hasten a product's functional or psychological undesirability. Many electronic devices, for example, are intentionally impossible to dismantle for repair or recycling, their brief use-career proceeding inexorably to a landfill. A sustainable design specialist who serves as a consultant to global businesses and governmental organizations, Chapman calls for the decoupling of economic activity from mindless material consumption and shows how to do it.Chapman shares his vision for an ``experience heavy, material light'' design sensibility. This vital and timely new design philosophy reveals how meaning emerges from designed encounters between people and things, explores ways to increase the quality and longevity of our relationships with objects and the systems behind them, and ultimately demonstrates why design can\textemdash and must\textemdash lead the transition to a sustainable future.},

Over the past forty years, designers have privileged human values such that human-centered design is seen as progressive. Yet because all that is not human has been depleted, made extinct, or put to human use, today's design contributes to the existential threat of climate change and the ongoing extinctions of other species. In Things We Could Design, Ron Wakkary argues that human-centered design is not the answer to our problems but is itself part of the problem. Drawing on philosophy, design theory, and numerous design works, he shows the way to a relational and expansive design based on humility and cohabitation. Wakkary says that design can no longer ignore its exploitation of nonhuman species and the materials we mine for and reduce to human use. Posthumanism, he argues, enables a rethinking of design that displaces the human at the center of thought and action. Weaving together posthumanist philosophies with design, he describes what he calls things\textemdash nonhumans made by designers\textemdash and calls for a commitment to design with more than human participation. Wakkary also focuses on design as ``nomadic practices''\textemdash a multiplicity of intentionalities and situated knowledges that shows design to be expansive and pluralistic. He calls his overall approach ``designing-with'': the practice of design in a world in which humans share center stage with nonhumans, and in which we are bound together materially, ethically, and existentially.},

The project consisted of four modules: an economic simulator, custom software to check factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of telex machines that were linked to one mainframe computer.Project Cybersyn was based on viable system model theory approach to organizational design, and featured innovative technology for its time: it included a network of telex machines (Cybernet) in state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in Santiago. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (Cyberstride) that would monitor production indicators, such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism, in "almost" real time, alerting the workers in the first case and, in abnormal situations, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges by a very large degree, also the central government. The information would also be input into economic simulation software (CHECO, for CHilean ECOnomic simulator) that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions. Finally, a sophisticated operations room (Opsroom) would provide a space where managers could see relevant economic data, formulate feasible responses to emergencies, and transmit advice and directives to enterprises and factories in alarm situations by using the telex network. The principal architect of the system was British operations research scientist Stafford Beer, and the system embodied his notions of organisational cybernetics in industrial management. One of its main objectives was to devolve decision-making power within industrial enterprises to their workforce in order to develop self-regulation of factories. After the military coup on September 11, 1973, Cybersyn was abandoned and the operations room was destroyed.},

The gesture recognition system uses image processing techniques for detection, segmentation, tracking and recognition of hand gestures for converting it to a meaningful command.

In this paper we highlight the implicit dichotomization between human and non-human that characterizes this body of literature. In so doing we approach the question of agency not as a subjective property emanating from a conscious self\textemdash what would be very much the way traditional anthropology has come to imagine animism. Rather, by turning such an understanding of agency on its head, we take the animacy of the inbetween as the starting point from which life unfolds. According to Tim Ingold's work on the subject, this view is consistent with the cosmologies of people traditionally described as ``animists.'' Yet unlike conventional understandings of the term, Ingold describes this ontology as an openness to a world in becoming. Here what brings things into existence is not an animating principle inscribed within them, but rather the potential of the field of relations in which they are embedded. We suggest that this analytical reversal can provide us with a novel framework for the analysis of infrastructures. Accordingly, we argue that roads' doings cannot be understood as active subjectivity or a function of their material resilience. Instead of connecting, roads should be understood as growing out of connections\textemdash as an ``in-between'' in which their doing is also their undergoing. We will make this argument through ethnographic cases from Pakistan, Nepal, China, Myanmar, and Austria.},

By way of case studies, we show how we explored the link between `the whole person' and desired interaction experience in a designerly way.

Beginning with this example, this chapter will argue for the value of investigating the details of Internet infrastructure as a method of studying the Internet and society more generally.

The people who build and maintain these infrastructures play integral roles in their functioning: in the tight and continuous cycles of contemporary software development, the thinking of developers shapes how data drives `data-driven' organizations. This article contributes to contemporary debates on infrastructural politics by describing how the vernacular social theorizing of one group of developers tangles with their technical work. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with developers of music recommender systems in the US, I examine how they understand the variability of music listeners. I find that the dominant frame for making sense of listener variation is avidity: a level of enthusiasm for music, which manifests as a willingness to expend effort in finding listening material. For people working in this industry, avidity displaces other ways of understanding human variety \textendash{} particularly demography. While the technical communities behind these systems were predominantly white and male, they understood the difference that set them apart from most users to be their enthusiasm for music. Centreing avidity provided a way to claim elite cultural status and to avoid talking about demographic diversity. It also reflects the infrastructures through which recommender system developers know and intervene upon their users: avidity is what users look like when seen through interaction logs. Less avid users leave fewer traces, and the goal of the recommender system is to encourage them to leave more. As a result, the figure of the less avid listener serves to justify increasingly rapacious data collection practices.},

\begin{itemize}

\item 
Developers shape how data drives data-driven organisations.

\item 
In the case of music recommendations the concept of avidity was centered.

\end{itemize}

\par
``Avidity manifests as an interest in musical exploration or a willingness to expend effort in pursuit of new music.'' (Seaver, 2021, p. 773)
\par
-
\par
in 2014 the technical workforce of Google and others were predominantly white and male.
\par
Critics located algorithmic failures in this lack of diversity since they view algorithms as socio-technical systems with human actants playing a crucial role.
\par
The paper argues that how the developers of such algorithms think about their social differences between themselves and the users have consequences for the design of the algorithms.
\par
``In this article, I examine how people working within algorithmic infrastructures make sense of these concerns: How do they think about the composition of their teams, the differences between themselves and their users, and the resulting technical consequences? I suggest that their vernacular social theorizing is entangled with the infrastructures that they build. As they think about what sets them apart from their users, and how that difference might be ameliorated, they find answers in the infrastructure.'' (Seaver, 2021, p. 773)
\par
Recommender system are thought of as post-demographic systems, because they go beyond classical categories of race, gender and age. Instead they operate upon the difference between developers and users. Within this context, demographic diversity was deemed unimportant, for at least until 2014.
\par
As quoted from said conference panel:
\par
``the technical functioning of recommendation `really comes down to the data, and the feedback, and how you process that information to make your product better'.'' (Seaver, 2021, p. 775)
\par
The diversity of the team developing the service doesn't matter for the endproduct here.
\par
Collaborative filter is the status quo in recommender systems.
\par
``people who liked the same things in the past will probably like the same things in the future. Collaborative filters analyze interactional data, like ratings given to movies or the time spent listening to a particular musical artist, and find patterns in it. When users share much of their listening history, their inferred preferences can be used to make recommendations to each other.'' (Seaver, 2021, p. 775)
\par
Collaborative filtering can transform ``thin'' interactional data into recommendations that seem to be culturally informed, without know anything about that culture. It was also positioned as a way out of demographic framing, although early material didn't know anything about those problematics. The companies developing recommender algorithms rather collect and evaluate behavioral data, saying that they are post-demographic and post-identity.
\par
This is a rather priviledged stance, as post-identity is marked as white and male and behavioral data is influenced by social facts.
\par
```not all efforts at segmentation and targeting are associated with commercial exploitation, marketplace discrimination and cumulative disadvantage' (2011, p. 133). In other applications of related technologies \textendash{} like predictive policing, for instance \textendash{} the dynamics of biased data collection, extreme power differentials, and self-reinforcing feedback call for much stronger critique'' (Seaver, 2021, p. 777)
\par
Although they tried hard to not make a demographic difference, there still are underlying differences at play. As a comment on the avidity pyramid, Jennings said
\par
``Such categories are always evolving' (p. 31). However, he continued, `Whether or not the subgroups are empirically watertight does not matter [...] the main point here is simply the existence of different groups''' (Seaver, 2021, p. 779)
\par
Nonetheless avidity became a central cornerstone in the understanding of music listeners by the developers and Jennings original comment vanished into the background. Avidity often stood for gender demographics in internal discussions of developers.
\par
The four categories of the pyramid were later abstraced into lean-forward (as in avid) and lean-backwards (as in non-avid). The large part of the users were lean-back, which was different from the developers, who where mostly lean-forward.
\par
``Avidity was thus a frame not only for understanding listener variation, but also for thinking about the cultural differences between the people who used recommender systems and the people who made them.'' (Seaver, 2021, p. 780)
\par
It seems like, that tech culture, or silicon valley culture, wants to position itself as neutral. Which is interesting in relation to the facebook paper. But having cultural capital avidity seemed very important in getting a job at a music recommender developer company, which already framed the team and it's diversity. This was critiqued as culture fit which was a homogenizing force.
\par
In tech general, but the music recommender field, qualitative research in user (experience) seemed very sparse, leading to the development of products for the developers themselves. This led to further differentiation between developers and users as devs couldn't imagine themselves as users. They tried to overcome this problem through data. Data was seen as objective (as in subconcious and non.lying)
\par
\textbf{Seeing like an infrastructure}
\par
``This is not to say that people like Tom were unaware that their users had lives extending beyond their platform; rather, for the purposes of recommendation, those lives were only relevant to the extent that they manifested as detectable patterns in interaction. If the goal of the recommender was to encourage listeners to stay listening, its success could be measured by how much these profiles grew over time'' (Seaver, 2021, p. 785)
\par
\textbf{Seeing like a market}
\par
```data imperative': `professionals recommend, the institutional environment demands, and technology enables organizations to sweep up as much individual data as possible' (2017, p. 13). This speculation on the value of data leads to a situation that Fourcade and Healy call `seeing like a market'\textendash the valorization of data as a new form of capital'' (Seaver, 2021, p. 786)

At the heart of the critical enterprise is an understanding of digital materiality, not framed as the intangibility of cyberspace using the superficial distinction between physical, surrogate, and virtual, but as the palpable bits and bytes of electronic hardware and software that are ubiquitous, that leave traces, and that can be read as evidence of the creation, dissemination, reception, and preservation of these new communication forms. Scholars like Matt Kirschenbaum and Alan Galey have rendered digital forensics necessary for the digital humanist's intellectual toolkit. This chapter surveys and extends those understandings by exploring how digital materiality is captured in metadata, in interfaces, in time- and date-stamped information processing, in the multivariate interactions of users and forms. In effect, digital documents reveal their own stories if you know where to look, what to analyze, and how to read their material legacy.},

``Such consignation or gathering, strictly speaking, implies ``to coordinate a single corpus, in a system or a synchrony in which all the elements articulate the unity of an ideal configuration'' and no ``absolute dissociation, [...] heterogeneity or secret'' can persist'' (Sieber, 2016, p. 27)
\par
So questions of power are quite interesting. By taking all of the open source code and quasi locking it away, with any access by anyone other then github (and the people wirking at the vault) GH amasses a lot of power.},

A consideration of Andean animism emphasizes how agency is located in the social relationship people have with the material world and how material objects can have social identities.},

  abstract = {The emergence of `Maker Culture' and `Maker Spaces' within formal (and informal) learning environments around the world can be seen as part of a wider shift in consciousness regarding the relationship between human and the material environment. This is reflected in theoretical and academic movements such as the `material turn': where concepts such as Jane Bennett's `vibrant matter' and Karen Barad's `intra-activity' have begun to displace human intention as the exclusive centre of agency. In this article, an engagement with DiY (Do-it-Yourself ) technologies is explored through an observation of the workshop environment of a single practitioner: uncovering strategies which allow material agency to re-function simple technologies into forms which would be difficult to reproduce using exclusively human intention. Deviating from the role of technology as an invisibly functioning tool, material media is defined as an approach to technologies which incorporates materials as active agents in the creative process of making of cultural artefacts. Through the use of redundant and discarded materials, the DiY practitioner examined in this article is seen to follow a Techno-Animist approach to media technologies: acknowledging the qualities of `vibrant matter'as an active component of agency; re-situating the human in relation to the material environment.},

Rules can be given which may encourage useful classification schemes, but in principle no single classification scheme can ever be exhaustive or meet all needs.

This study adopts a materiality-inspired methodology to explore ATs and to elicit insights into the perceptions and emotions of the study participants towards them. A comparative exploratory study between the UK and Taiwan has been conducted to explore diverse and cross-cultural perceptions. The findings suggest that the design of ATs needs to go beyond traditional considerations, such as price and compliance, and instead focus on how these products enhance users' positive sense of self. This in return may increase the rate of successful adoption of ATs in everyday life.},

Infrastructure is both relational and ecological\textemdash it means different things to different groups and it is part of the balance of action, tools, and the built environment, inseparable from them. It also is frequently mundane to the point of boredom, involving things such as plugs, standards, and bureaucratic forms. Some of the difficulties of studying infrastructure are how to scale up from traditional ethnographic sites, how to manage large quantities of data such as those produced by transaction logs, and how to understand the interplay of online and offline behavior. Some of the tricks of the trade involved in meeting these challenges include studying the design of infrastructure, understanding the paradoxes of infrastructure as both transparent and opaque, including invisible work in the ecological analysis, and pinpointing the epistemological status of indictors.},

Based on current debates on the growing relevance of archival documents in American Studies and adjacent fields, it stakes out a framework that leans on recent work in a small branch of contemporary literary theory focused on historical epistemology, especially with regard to the notion of `epistemic objects'. Engaging these theoretical concerns, the article discusses concrete archival collections and documents, including letters by the novelist Willa Cather and items from a capacious archive documenting the emergence and evolution of Andrew Carnegie's public library philanthropy. I outline several ways in which the shape and the aesthetics of such archives embody the information economies and epistemic situations of the past \textendash{} in this case, the formative period around 1900. Finally, the article addresses the digital document overload that confronts the contemporary researcher and comments on the emerging archival knowledge culture of today's humanities.},

Although infrastructures are invisible in many ways\textemdash because of their size, because they are hidden, or because they are so foundational\textemdash those whose livelihoods are endangered by infrastructures are keenly aware of them. In-person and online action against the Dakota Access Pipeline brought dramatic attention to oil infrastructure even though the pipeline was not only not visible, it was not yet built. I argue that the practices that make infrastructure perceptible\textemdash whether technological, geographical, social, or historical\textemdash are also always political. This study sets the efforts of Oceti Sokowin, other Indigenous, and non-Indigenous water protectors into the context of U.S. infrastructure history to examine the wide-ranging effects of the dominance of sight in infrastructural awareness and to make the case that infrastructures are not normally functional, whether by inevitable accident or in the more fundamental failure of infrastructures' imbrication with settler colonialism in North America. Rerouting entrenched habits of perception helps to correct some of the damaging legacies of using sight as a metric for value, to foreground the fundamental nature of infrastructural breakdown, and to expand definitions of infrastructures to better account for their far-reaching and diverse dependencies and effects.},

  abstract = {While ongoing debates about any field are important to the continued development of that field, this chapter suggests that for the digital humanities, we now need to go beyond day-to-day issues and visionary long-term speech, and focus on the intermediate time perspective. This means coming up with a model that resolves many of the key tensions that currently characterize the field within a given time frame. It is argued that it is not enough to enlarge the tent of digital humanities, reluctantly let in newcomers, or mount alternative movements. Such a model will need to be inclusive and accommodating, allowing for heterogeneity while also being sharp enough to be meaningful. This does not mean breaking with earlier traditions, but taking the need for a new, consolidated platform seriously. Such a platform must have an intellectual and technological foundation, and, arguably, relate to mainstream humanities and the university as a whole, while engaging in intellectual pursuit, technological innovation, building of sustainable infrastructure, and facilitating critical making. It must be built on respect, mutual interest, and, to some extent, compromise. It is argued in this chapter that the only way to achieve this is to think of the digital humanities as an intersectional meeting place and trading zone, allow for engagement with the digital across different modes of engagement, and use infrastructure as a way of channeling resources and articulating an ideational underpinning. Such a model is not territorial, but requires the digital humanities to have integrity and the ability to empower the development of research and education. In outlining this model, there is a specific focus on intermediate-term practical implementation.},

Companies add internet connectivity to more and more items, to transmit data and work more efficiently \textendash{} a development known as the internet of things.    In the end, Giaccardi is convinced that this approach opens up new design possibilities. ``I believe that things have a different opinion on how they would be designed,'' she says. ``Where designers see misuse of an item, it provides an untapped resource for design.'' It's a bizarre idea but maybe one day, objects will be able to design objects. That's the sincere belief of Elisa Giaccardi. Currently, design and manufacturing processes are centred around factors such as cost-effectiveness and optimal design \textendash{} so is that wrong? ``No,'' says Giaccardi, ``it's just that these days, there are more opportunities to design products that are more radically innovative.''

As a concept and a reality, the backlog is a critical point of failure, carrying with it an ongoing and prevailing sense that `deferred maintenance' has become the norm in the archive.

Rather, what we design is a thing or an environment in which a computer might be used to create certain desired effects. Indeed, interaction design in a sense becomes the practice of giving form to artifacts or environments rather like any of the other design disciplines that we have know for centuries. However, giving form to computational things is highly complex and somewhat different than most other form-giving practices due to its temporal form element \textendash{} its ability to change between states. Thus, an interaction design practice needs to encompass this temporal form-giving in combination with physical form-giving, and performances of the interaction gestalt. In this paper I propose this trinity of forms as a framework to unfold the practice of interaction design. I further demonstrate how computational composites present a way to work with the temporal form and the physical form in a process not too different from any traditional form-giving practice. Lastly, I point to some tools and techniques to deal with the interdependencies of the three form-elements and thereby also demonstrate that a form-giving practice of interaction design is already well under way.},

It is precisely these interpretative aspects of humanities research that are often felt as being at odds with the perceived scientific empirical paradigm found in computer science and software design. The digital humanities is a field where this clear tension between hermeneutical narrative and quantified patterns surfaces.

  abstract = {Mid-air interaction involves touchless manipulations of digital content or remote devices, based on sensor tracking of body movements and gestures. There are no established, universal gesture vocabularies for mid-air interactions with digital content or remote devices based on sensor tracking of body movements and gestures. On the contrary, it is widely acknowledged that the identification of appropriate gestures depends on the context of use, thus the identification of mid-air gestures is an important design decision. The method of gesture elicitation is increasingly applied by designers to help them identify appropriate gesture sets for mid-air applications. This paper presents a review of elicitation studies in mid-air interaction based on a selected set of 47 papers published within 2011\textendash 2018. It reports on: (1) the application domains of mid-air interactions examined; (2) the level of technological maturity of systems at hand; (3) the gesture elicitation procedure and its variations; (4) the appropriateness criteria for a gesture; (5) participants number and profile; (6) user evaluation methods (of the gesture vocabulary); (7) data analysis and related metrics. This paper confirms that the elicitation method has been applied extensively but with variability and some ambiguity and discusses under-explored research questions and potential improvements of related research.},

It shows how this new industrial development becomes a part of state-making and regional identity-building processes by triggering the re-scaling of territories and shaping new geographies in relation to expanding cloud infrastructures. Tracing those infrastructure-making processes reveals some of the key dynamics between the Swedish state, its regions and the global IT economy.},

Proponents of technically driven digital humanities insist that we must be builders, and that digital humanities students must learn to program, code, and create digital resources. Those more interested in theory, most notoriously Stanley Fish, object that digital humanities is crudely positivist, under-theorized, and insufficiently self-critical, and does not address questions for example of representation of race, gender, and sexuality, nor engage with cultural criticism. This chapter examines details of the debate and discusses whether the two sides can, or should, be reconciled. It examines earlier discussions about theory and method in English studies and history, as they grew into mature disciplines, and asks what digital humanities can learn from the development of these two fields, as it seeks to shape its own future.},

"once the fabricated object leaves the factory, there is the way in which it will design the actions of its users, according to the inherent delimitations of how it can be used \textemdash{} here we can think of equipment, appliances and other functional objects as having 'horizons of use', similar to Gadamer's notion of interpretation as 'an interaction between the horizon provided by the text and the horizon that the interpreter brings to it'.[13] Interpretation is inseparable from the ontological designing process.[14]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=3}{Willis 2006:71})

"The risk is a loss of specificity in which ontological designing could be seen as equivalent to 'environmental determinism', carrying no more agency than 'influence' (as in 'the influence of environment upon individuals', where neither what constitutes environment nor what kind of action 'influence' is, are ever spelt out)."

"Interpretation happens in innumerable ordinary everyday situations, such as when something breaks down and the user has to examine it in order to fix it. This produces an understanding of how the thing works, which is not the same as knowing how to use it, and furthermore the understanding gained will very likely modify the way in which it is used in future (how it's held, how much pressure is applied, etc); nevertheless the interpretation didn't start from ground zero, from a position of absolute objectivity, it came out of an everyday involvement which carried with it a particular understanding of the functioning of the thing, but the breakdown opened up a space for interpretation, an opportunity towards disclosure of the thing itself."

"(i) we are born into and come to be human in language; (ii) we appropriate it, modify it, perhaps put words together in ways that they have not been combined before, encounter new situations which require new words; (iii) thus in appropriating language we also change it, and language-as-changed in turn acts back on us as language users.[18]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=5}{Willis 2006:73})

\par
"The weight and agency of design here depends upon where the emphasis is read \textemdash{} if 'designed for' is read as 'allowed for' this would suggest that the occupants' journey though time also had some other manifestation which was only facilitated by the (designed) artefactual spaces of their dwelling." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=7}{Willis 2006:75})

"the jug achieves its thinging through its emptiness, through the nothingness that is its centre. The jug gathers liquid, and if the liquid is wine, it also gathers the sun that shines and the water that falls upon the earth and nurtures the vine from which the wine is made. In its holding, the jug thus performs a profound gathering, which is also a giving, for the jug is also designed for outpouring. Its outpouring quenches thirst, its outpouring is a gift: in the gift of water, in the gift of wine, sky and earth dwell. But the gift of the outpouring is what makes the jug a jug. In the jugness of the jug, sky and earth dwell.[TT, 172]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4E2PW9N7?page=9}{Willis 2006:77})

\par
"The jug and the juice box are literally worlds apart, and so to is their worlding. Heidegger's jug is located in (an idealised) pre-modern culture of crafted artefacts made from earth, a world of direct connection between the nurturer of the fruit, the earth in which it grows, the spread on the table and of giving thanks to the divinities. The juice box on the office worker's desk sits within a totally desacralised, instrumentalised culture of convenience where a worker's productivity has nothing to do with soil, rain and the bounty of the gods, and everything to do with de-materialised output of electronic work and production, which has no place for the gathering of eating, only for the sustenance of working bodies which can be conveniently met by products like singleserve juice boxes."

\par
"Once ontological designing is allowed to perform its unconcealment, once the idea is appropriated \textemdash{} i.e., that things have the capacity to 'thing', a different kind of designing becomes possible.

This is true for both, but in different ways, single function objects (e.g. a lawnmower, a gadget) and complex multifunctional system-things such as computers, which rather than inducting us into a world of multiple creative possibilities (as software advertisers would have it), design us as users into their horizons of possibility \textemdash{} which by the very nature of horizons (in Gadamer's sense) always have a limit."

  abstract = {Children's play objects are increasingly shaped by technological innovations that can transform them into hybrid, internet-connected toys, a phenomenon referred to as the Internet of Toys. Previous research has presented user research on connected toys, but little is known how to approach them from a design perspective. This paper investigates whether and how an animistic design perspective can foster a fruitful exploration of the design potentialities of connected toys. It addresses this question by analysing three design concepts of connected toys that were developed in the course of an R\&D project. These included a high-tech bracelet with digital passport, a card game with a customizable 3D-printed figurine, and a robot as a board game play mate. The results show how the design qualities of connected toys can be categorized on a spectrum ranging from a certainty-driven, problem-solving logic to an uncertainty-driven, animistic design perspective. The contribution of this study is a better understanding of how connected toys emerge in a broader ecology of children, toys, and data that all act upon each other. By embracing the uncertainty in this complex and fluid network of subjects and objects, the animistic design perspective allows to explore a broad set of design opportunities relevant in the realm of the Internet of Toys.},

We believe an animistic design perspective is promising to guide the analysis and exploration of the design qualities of connected toys."

"The animistic design perspective embraces this power of uncertainty, which can be considered as a fourth principle." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=3}{Zaman et al 2018:172})

"children ascribe human and life-like qualities to inanimate object like robots, including cognitive, behavioral, and especially affective characteristics. Similarly, [27] have shown that children conceptualized and interacted with a robotic dog in ways that were like a live dog."

"Especially when it concerns smart things and AI agents, people of all ages are likely to consider them as alive (whereas in reality they are not), give them attitude and personality [1] (whereas in reality they are configured), see them as intelligent (whereas they are dumb [23]), having broad capabilities (whereas these are actually rather limited [28]) [2]."

"Analysis The analysis can be considered as a particular type of expert evaluation, complementing (not replacing) user and technical research. The instances of the three concepts that emerged out of the development weeks (supra), were reanalysed from an animistic design perspective following a 2-step process." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=6}{Zaman et al 2018:175})
\par
"In the first analysis phase, we explored each design concept from the perspective of animistic design, questioning whether and how the design qualities would foster or inhibit 1) agency, 2) embodiment, 3) a certain ecology of objects and subjects, and 4) uncertainty (cf., supra). Based on the analytical lens of agency, we defined new codes relating to 'autonomy', 'domination, 'simulation', and 'negotiation'. The combination of the perspective of agency with the notion of an ecology, led to the definition of the following new codes: '(in)dependence', and 'divergent interactions'. The analytical lens of embodiment and ecology led to an investigation and discussion of 'boundaries' in the connected toys concepts. The notion of uncertainty did not yield new codes during the analysis, but was helpful to further characterize and flesh out each of the new codes presented above."

\par
"The Bracelet concept hinted upon several animistic design principles in affording children to interact with it in an ecology of heterogeneous, tangible, networked objects that act upon each other in uncertain ways. It does not rely on the typical command and response pattern present in traditional user-interface interactions. It is indeed an essential characteristic of animistic design "to fit a messy, serendipitous process of constant reassessment, enriching open-ended situations" [3:2255]. The meaning of the Bracelet is incomplete when children do not co-construct its significance, which signifies the embodied nature of animistic design and echoes [23:228] statement that agency in animistic designs is not something that objects have, but only exists in relation to its user(s) or in its encounters with other things and data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=7}{Zaman et al 2018:176})
\par
"We do note, however, that design qualities can afford an animistic interpretation, but even without these qualities being present, children still have the agency to creatively bring these objects to live." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=7}{Zaman et al 2018:176})
\par
"Future studies on animistic design could then consider triangulating data in a research design that combines adult expert evaluations of the design qualities with an analysis of empirical data based on participation of children and parents. Doing so would allow us to actually treat the human and non-human activities on an equal stand, which is a key characteristic of animistic design, and posthumanist research in general."

They see archives as hegemonic, characterizing ways of thought, modes of colonization, and the control of citizens. However, they also make clear that archives can be read subversively. With patience, counter-readings allow the excavation of the voices (sometimes names) of subaltern and otherwise suppressed others from the archive. By reading along and across the archival grain, researchers can follow the development of ideas and processes across historical periods. Archives can be seen as orphanages, containing surrogates of performances. Archives (paper and digital) also provide access to the results of anthropological research in ways mandated by ethics codes, but these are subject to controversy. What sorts of consent and what sorts of anonymization should be provided? Archives run by the groups traditionally studied by anthropologists provide models of radical archives that are very different from those conceived of by traditional archivists.},
