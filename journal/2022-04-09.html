        <p>Three days after the last entry I got a positiv test on covidâ€¦ so my post-achievement depression was probably also related to that. Iâ€™m always becoming super depressed when having a cold, the flu, or â€¦ covid it seems.</p>
        <p>But the reflection helped me tons nonetheless. I started digging computing with limits, environmental aware computing, permacomputing and similar concepts. Some of the readings I enjoyed:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>I continued planing the solar server, about which you could read more unter <a href="notes/Solar%20Sensitivities.html">Solar Sensitivities</a>. I had to learn some basics about batteries, power, electricity and all the important concepts like volt, watt, and ampereâ€¦ I will probably buy the necessary hardware with the next paycheck and will care about the software side until then. That stuff at least I know by heart.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m also preparing my PhD proposal which gives me a lot of joy. It is basically about how we can think participatory about data in archives. There is stil a lot of work to be done to focus down on what Iâ€™m actually about to do. Just this week I started to read about records in context, which is a new standard in thinking and organizing data for archives. It got me quite excited ðŸ˜…</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>With RiC, the fundamental archival principles - the provenance principle and the principle of preserving and clarifying the original contexts of records - are to be given their place in the world of linkable metadata.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Last but not least I started to learn uxn, which is an assembler language for creative computing. Parallel I opened up an account on a mastodon instance to share my journey and to interact with likeminded people. The community I found is super nice and I feel very good there. It is a complete different feeling then, say, Twitter or Instagram. Here is a screenshot of some uxntal code and the compiled result.</p>

        <p>I guess sooner or later I have to write my own thoughts on permacomputing approaches, and maybe even make a link to animism.</p>
