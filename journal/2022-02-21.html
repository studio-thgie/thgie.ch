        <p>I made myself a memo to think about getting <em>back</em> into blogging. Quite a long time ago I had a super tense blog where I tried to be super hype. I blogged because I wanted to have an audience to show all the cool things that I read and watch, in order to convey how cool I am‚Ä¶ Didn‚Äôt succeed üòÖ</p>
        <p>A quick research brings up some nice links on how and why to blog<a href="journal/2022-02-21.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Of the many reasons offered, I personally liked the <em>improve your writing</em> the best. Now, with my pivot into academia I can‚Äôt get enough writing practice and a blog will help me out by being a place with little pressure.</p>
        <p>A quick note about my setup. Since I‚Äôm a programmer I feel quite comfortable with a little nerdy stack. I‚Äôm writing in Visual Studio Code with the <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/">foam plugin</a>. I already used this setup for my MA thesis documentation and also to write my thesis paper with the help of pandoc. I then have the whole thing version through git and hosted on github through mkdocs. Maybe I‚Äôll write about that some day üòå.</p>
