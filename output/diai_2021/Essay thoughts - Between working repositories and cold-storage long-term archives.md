> We are now also opening up the initial compilation of Tech Tree resources to community input. Inspired by the Long Now Foundation's Manual for Civilization, the Tech Tree is a collection of technical works which document and explain the layers of technology on which today's open-source software relies, along with works included to provide additional cultural context for the Arctic Code Vault. We invite further suggestions and recommendations; please create a pull request for any specific proposed additions, deletions, or edits. You can also open an issue if you have a more general idea, although we particularly encourage specific and concrete suggestions in the form of pull requests.
