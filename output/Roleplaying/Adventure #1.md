Introduction to the adventure <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhIl_ie7Zs4>

Mystery: Sister gets kidnapped by bot, leaves behind little audio device as only connection to her.

It was the middle of summer, and my little sister, Pauline, had tried to follow me and my friend around for weeks. Her best friend was out of town and my mother tried, without much success, to arouse my sympathy. I had always taken care of Pauline, not only because of her hearing impairment, but because there has always been something fragile about her, as if she can be easily damaged or broken. However, this summer had awakened the desire in me to ride as far away as possible on my bike, and to do things on my own. When Pauline suddenly disappeared, guilt hit me like a blow to the stomach, and I remembered she had talked about meeting a new friend called Johnny.

We found them at Pauline's favorite spot. It's a small opening in between some trees at the rundown parc near our house. We crept toward them through the tall grass as the wind tore at the pines. A woodpecker could be heard in the distance. Pauline sat on a stone and leaned forward to place a daisy chain on the head of a runaway robot, her new friend “Johnny.” I signaled to my friend Juhan to keep quiet and snuck around to the other side. When I looked back, Johnny was staring at me, its eyes narrowing to tiny black dots as it took my sister in its arms.

- What do you do?

(The goal is to make the player go after Johnny)

[Scene: Car Street] A wild chase breaks out. Johnny has Pauline in his grips and goes full speed on his tracks. A robot going haywire is nothing to worring, they do that sometimes, but they never really harm anybody. But there is something about Johnny that makes you uneasy, something sinister. Johnny races into the direction of your home, down the street. Several cars have to move out of his ways, one almost crashes into a telephone-pole, but can top in the last moment. You see your sisters face, she doesn't look to happy.

- What do you do?

You race along the street, after Johnny, trying to evade the cars, which in turn are evading Johnny. 
- Dice for Ausweichen
-> success: getting closer
-> fail: seeing Johnny taking the curve

You are getting closer
- Dice for Ausdauer
-> success: No matter how much, Johnny is quicker
-> fial: seeing Johnny taking the curve

[Scene: Home] You see Johnny, your sister still in his grips, take the turnoff into your homestreet. You follow them. Your street is XXX. The door to your home is open and you conclude that they must have gone there. Juhan finally catched up and the both of you enter the house. 

- Describe the house for me

You hear rumbling from the cellar. It's not your favorite place after the horror movie that you saw last night. But your sister always like to hang around down there, going through your parents boxes. They promised adventure!

- What do you do

The last thing you see is Johnny and your sister going into some kind of portal. It didn't look like he is forcing her. She went in there by her own choice. The portal closes. Upon investigation you find on of her favorite playthings, an object that acts as a kind of walky talky, it's on and emitting some strange noises cracking and zirping.

You hear your sister. She says: Everything is ok, don't wait for me, just listen.

You hear nothing anymore.
