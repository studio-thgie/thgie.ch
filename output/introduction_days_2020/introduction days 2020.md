# introduction days 2020

Who are you and what is your background?

- software development, also working this right now for 60%
- ba in industrial design in basel
- scientific assistant at the ixdm, if lucky 30% next year
- to know me personally a bit better, ceramics and japan

What is your project idea’s central design or research question?

- [[20200622133817]] Research Questions
- [[20200907192342]] things are people too

    - we usually know animism as the belief-system of indigenous people and communities
    - on animism
    - on the problem of technological consumption
    - I want to bring these two things together and see if animism can actually help with the technological consumption
    - on the involvement of design

- Wie wird unser Zugang zu technologischen Produkten und Prozessen durch animistische Ansätze in deren Gestaltung verändert? Inwieweit kann Animismus in Design einen nachhaltigeren Umgang zu Technologie mit sich bringen? Was sind mögliche positive sowohl auch negative Auswirkungen eines solchen Ansatzes?

-  Can animistic views and practices be found in approaches in our society, even if it can no longer show any animistic tradition? Can animistic practices in design lead to a more intensive connection to technological products and processes? What are the effects of such a relationship?

Research Process

- voice assistants

- three pases
- ap1: anthropological research: participatory observations as well as interviews with a focus on animistic weak signals
- ap2: design research: prototyping narratives, prototypes with physical as well as immaterial aspects around an allready existing technology
- ap3: testing

What is the connection between your project idea and your education, career and life thus far?

- it's a passion project, doesn't make it easier
- i'm very entangled with technology
- animism follows me since about 20 years, when i was in tokyo, first time i ca seriously tackle the subject

What is the societal relevance of your project?

- basically i'm tackling the wastefull aspect of technology consumption
- theoretical level, there could be some knowledge generation that would be interesting for design theory as well as critical theory

What career goal are you pursuing with your project idea?

- transition from software development to academic career
- through the experience i made at the ixdm as well as zhdk i know i want to work in such a context in the future

How should your supervisor support you? Who could supervise your project?

- two coaches - robert and laura coppens
- robert can in my case help a bit less with his expertise in design history, but is super valuable for reflection, sharpening as well as learning about the research process
- first semester x y, berlin based, didn't have the time i would have needed
- since then laura coppens, phd candidate at the institute for social anthropology at the uni bern
- she takes a liken to my project, can help me reflect on the anthropological aspects as well as the research process
