# From methods to practice: Thoughts on the sustainability of archival software within a research setting

This presentation is concerned with the sustainability of technological creations that accompany and support our research in the digital humanities.

These can be software, data structures, trained models for machine learning, and others. Since these artefacts are an essential part of the knowledge we produce, we need to ensure their long-term survival alongside our other outputs, such as academic writing. Technological artefacts are often dependent on complex systems and environments that are neither robust nor can function without maintenance.

How do these premises shape our methods in the creation of said artefacts? How can we balance prototyping and sustain outputs in the long term? Alternatively, what could be a sustainable approach to technological artefacts in the digital humanities?

This presentation draws on my longstanding practice as a software developer. I want to touch on these topics by showing how these thoughts and problems influence the design and creation of digital archival software within the project «Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives».

## Thoughts
- vielleicht auf computing withing limits eingehen?
- *From methods to practice: How imaginaries and digital materialities shape the sustainability of our research*
- bei scifi artefakten anfangen
- wie unsere vorstellung (imaginaries) des outputs unsere methodik im jetzt beeinflusst
- reduce complexity in method, eg paper computing to teach computing instead of a full blown machine

## Input Peter
- Publikum sind Docs und Profs
- Nachhaltigkeit Methodik
- Vergänglichkeit des Codes/Outputs
