# Dissertation Proposal
## Abstract
The infrastructure of an archive manifests its participatory ontology and shapes the possibility space for epistemological practices. This research proposal wants to look at the development of a digital image archive from an infrastructural point of view and inquire how design decisions and technical implementations on that level influence its participatory character. The focus of this work is the inquiry into the imaginaries and models of communal managed data, which is regarded as the core materiality of a digital archive.

## Context
This research proposal relates to the subproject B2.3, which is the software development for the implementation of the user interface and is adapted  for in order for this proposal to fit my own profile. The scope of B2.3 has expanded to the point, that the development includes the full stack of technologies necessary to run a digital archival platform. Initially, only the implementation of the frontend was considered, but I am by now in charge of or involved in all levels of conception and technical implementation. As such, this proposal relates to the issues and goals of the parent research project *Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA)*[^1].

## Introduction
Archival infrastructures enable and regulate the flow of resources, archival material, and knowledge between several actors, some of which can be positioned inside of the archival infrastructure and some of which are located on the outside.

In PIA, we inquire about the participatory potentials of digital image archives in comparison to their analog versions, and how to expand on that potential where present. As of now, this inquiry happens mainly on the level of the content of the archive and in the interplay between different human actants who pandare interested in engaging with that material. The reasons for this interest can differ and be initiated by either from within the archive or actants outside the archive. 

Participatory approaches depend on the distinguishing of an inside and an outside. Inside are human actants who are considered *experts* on archival practices as well as the content of the archive. The people on the outside need further specification, but generally is consituted by an interested public. These *amateurs*, which may or may not be *experts*, are characterized by their engagement with the material, or the archive itself.

Derrida made a similar observation when he noted that archives need certain exteriority, an outside.

> "As “[t]here is no archive without a place of consignation, without a technique of repetition, and without a certain exteriority”, there is “[n]o archive without outside”" [@sieberPoliticsArchivesMedia2016, p. 27]

In his analysis he refers to the localization of the archive, pointing towards its materiality. Not explicitly mentioned but included is the social outside. Human actants which are not part of the archives many processes but who help sustain it, for example through financing it, delivering material, or enriching the existing.

> “Already in the ancient residences of superior magistrates filing official documents, archives, according to Derrida, “needed at once a guardian and a localization”, and thus “could neither do without substrate nor without residence”. Archives therefore “take place in a domiciliation”, and their ‘documents’ are “only kept and classified under the title of the archive by virtue of a privileged topology”” [@sieberPoliticsArchivesMedia2016, p. 26]

- something about community

Each archive has its focus, materialities as well as preservation strategies. Generally seen, the infrastructure of an archive becomes the place that enables archival and research practices. I work with the term or concept of infrastructure as outlined and championed by Susan Leigh Star and Brian Larkin. [@starEthnographyInfrastructure1999, @larkinPoliticsPoeticsInfrastructure2013]. Infrastructure then becomes a  socio-material assemblage [@rippaInfrastructureArchiveArchiving2020] that reaches farther than its mere technicalities. Infrastructure is not just the server on which images are archived, but also the technical and visual interfaces through which these can be accessed, the protocols and standards that regulate exchange, and the user and role management in place which dictate who is an expert, and who is a citizen scientist.

The Software Heritage foundation considers software as its epistemology, whereas source code is the only human-readable version of software [@dicosmoSoftwareHeritageWhy2017]. Archival software then becomes the manifestation of knowledge on how the former mentioned infrastructural relationships are instantiated. Being of digital matter, archival software has a specific potential for participatory approaches within the context of development with far-reaching consequences on the levels of participation on the level of content and archival and research practices[^2]. 

Looking at archives from an infrastructural point of view, we can see that decisions on that level shape the space of possibilities in the interaction with the users. Nick Seaver, an anthropologist of socio-technological matters, studied the development of music recommendation systems. He observed how the developer's perception of the user of these systems shaped the infrastructure, which in turn marred the space of participation within the system [@seaverSeeingInfrastructureAvidity2021]. The users became visible to the system only through desirable data points.

> “But infrastructures also exist as forms separate from their purely technical functioning, and they need to be analyzed as concrete semiotic and aesthetic vehicles oriented to addressees. They emerge out of and store within them forms of desire and fantasy and can take on fetish-like aspects that sometimes can be wholly autonomous from their technical function.” [@larkinPoliticsPoeticsInfrastructure2013]

## Problems and general questions

Interesting in this context is the comparison to public libraries, which have similar epistemological functions, but a different approach towards the public, the outside. Libraries, says Shannon Mattern, "are designed through really robust programs of civic engagement", and "that [the] really diverse local community is often invited into the design process" [@ShannonMattern2022]. The outcome of those processes is often, that the community feels a sense of ownership in this particular place.

- In danger of reproducing old power structures through the division of in and out
- The digital archive has the potential to expell the material limits given by the analog archive
- Data is viewed as technical means whereas it should be also be considered as a central aspect of the digital archive
- Participation regarding this infrastructural issue opens up interesting questions

## Data as transversal materiality
- explain what is meant by data

Due to the scope of the project as well as this research proposal, the infrastructure of the digital image archive must be inquired through a specific lense. I suggest to use *data* as a boundary object as it is most fitting to my own profile as interface between digital humanities, design and as a service provider to the team of cultural anthropology.

Within the infrastructure of a digital archive, data becomes a boundary object between the many actants that partake in archival activities. It draws a transversal line from the outside to the inside, and back again. What are participatory imaginaries for data within the context of a digital image archive, such as data commons or data trusts?

- What are communal models and imaginaries of data management that favour participatition within a digital image archive?

## Research Design
For this research proposal, the following aspects of infrastructure can be identified, but not all of them can/will be considered. They are providing the anchor points of the transversal points of constituting, transforming, storing and generally working on data.

- own background in design research lends itself for the choice of methods
- trace the transversal line and identify where what kind of imaginaries of participation and data manifest themselves and consitute the data landscape/environment of the digital image archive
	- Archival data infrastructure as means of preserving and researching (Team A)
	- Means of working with archival data, such as tools or affordances (Team C)
	- Technical realization of an archival data infrastructure (Team B)
	- Epistemology of source code/software (All teams, Digital Humanities)

How the infrastructure, the software, and its technological ecosystem, are conceived, considered, and implemented influences and is influenced by every other approach within PIA. As such, the base for this research proposal needs an ongoing analysis of all actants and their ontologies through actor-network theory.

Such an analysis will have to capture practices, desires, ideas as well as networks and hierarchies of actants as they are about to develop new archival infrastructure. The actants that are involved in the realization and implementation are of special interests as they are epistemological bottlenecks, where all the former passes through and is formed into the PIA prototype.

### Methods
- Analyzing similar projects' infrastructure and development processes (Comparison, Actor-Network-Theory)
	- ANT analysis
	- Expert interviews
- Expert interviews with all human actants that are tasked with the conception and creation of (non-human actants) structures, tools, interfaces and so forth that constitute, shape, transform, read and write data in all it's forms.
- Mapping of the different forms data takes throughout it
- Analyzing the different models for shared data responsibilities
- Analyzing the technical infrastructure and its influence on participation
	- Analysis of X examples of other comparable projects' design and development and the emergence of affordances
- Practice-based Research (prototype)
	- Documenting and analyzing the development process of all relevant actants (Process-documentation)
- Participatory research with and through a community with a focus on the technical development of a digital image archive

## Relevance
Generate knowledge about the infrastructure of a digital image archive from a multi-disciplinary perspective that includes anthropology, technological aspects as well as design research.

Furthers the discourse on what constitutes inside/outside, which is a basic issue when regarding participatory approaches to digital image archives.

This research proposal is considering expanding the current participatory approach towards community building. Thinking participatory on the level of infrastructure enables the project to exist sustainably. It opens the infrastructure to a community that can carry and support the project after the end of the project.
