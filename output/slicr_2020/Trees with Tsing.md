#### Friction

House posts resprouted into trees. Forest trees grew back from old swiddens. Fruits and
rattans were planted in the growing forest. Forest giants were cleaned and
claime<l for their potential for attracting honeybees. People read the land­
scape for its social as well as its natural stories. s.xi

 First they take the trees. When the trees are finished
they come for the gold. \Vhen die gold is finished, they come for the coai'. s.22

Uma Adang tells me
that every tree is coming down, including fruit and honcy trees. You can get
up to Rp. 150,000 for giving permission to fell a tree on your anccstral lands;
you might as well give permission, because the� will fell the t1:ee whether
you give it or not. You hear tl1e sound of the cham saw; b� th� tune yo� get
thcrc, the tree has becn fellecl. s.23

Plans were set in motion to save the environment in the
process of destroying it. Tree plantations were introduced to rcstore defor­
ested and degraded land. Only then was the landscape deforested and de­
graded to make way for the restorative tree plantations. s. 32

On e lo o k back: Grand schemes ncver fully colonize the territories upon
which they are imposed. If the fr ontier is an environmental project, not a
p l ace, it can ncver fill the landscape . Away from th e Jogging road, there are
trees, fields, and villages. The frontier could m o v e on; the forest might re­
generate. s.36
#tree/as-landscape

 Thc road
runs for miles through land without underbrush or animal life but o nly
neatly planted tree stock; row on row an row.  The transmigration villages

[T]he world is a great library, and Fruit trees are some of his Bookes
wherein we may read and see plainly the Attributes of God bis Power,

 John Ray, known for his "grammar" of botany
(Atran 1990: 61), obviously read van Reede: "Who could believe that in one
province of Malabar, hardly a vast place, there could be three hundred
unique, indigenous species of trees and fmit?" (Ray 1686: sig. A3v quoted in
Drayton 2000: 18). Yet he attributed no importance to the Ezhava dialogue
that brought those species to him. The system itself was knowledge, not its
component parts. s.93

"Reduced impact Jogging" offers the solution of managing timber industry
workers to address the problem of logging's destructive impact. Other
ITTO grants sponsor studies of illegal logging-one of the fcw cvils on
which state bureaucracies, the timber industry, and tree-counting conserva­
tionists can agree.These activities advance the bureaucratic ideal;  s.110
#tree/as-abstract

We passed through gorges
lincd with tropical vines where wc touched hcart-shaped aroicl lcavcs as big as
picture windows and exclaimed at blooming trees with monkeys jumping in
thc branches. Yet on both sides of the main trail, the trees were straightboled,
evenly spacecl, and park-like in their orderlincss, with clcared ground bc­
tween them. Pure stands of pines further interrupted my stereotypes of the
tropics. I guessed we were in an old tree plantation.  s.124

As for riverside lua rees, we talked as much about the animals attracted to the 48. bayuan: a tall trcc with tree because of its fruit as about its human uses. s. 157

For an observer used to imagining agriculture as cleanly
weeded lines of corn, wheat, or tomatoes, but not all tossed
wgcther, the most amazing thing about a Meratns swiddcn
{ield is the extraordinary num ber of plants growing together
in the samc small spot. There may be trees saved from the
forest that was cut to makc the ficld: fruit trees, ho.ncy trecs,
sugar palms.  s.165
#tree/as-sustenance

dense clumps of sugar canc, spreading
sqnashes, gangling banana and papaya trees, gingers and
basils :md medicinal plants, and on and on. s.165
#tree/as-sustenance #tree/is-banana #tree/is-papaya

 Banana plants takc eighteen months to benr fruit; sugar
cane takes more than a year to reach an edible size; papaya
trees, when they finally fruit, bear for at least tive ycars.  s.166

I could tel1 right away that peopl.e enjoyed telling me wh.ich
fish were in the river, which insects made noises, which

If the houseposts are made of
sungkai (Peronema canescens), they may have sprouted and bccome new,
quick-growing secondary forest trees. Within a few years, it would be hard
for a stranger to know that a house had been there.Yet there is a grove of
fruit trees gathercd together near this spot.These arc the trces we "planted"
by throwing their seeds out the door. s.176
#tree/as-harmony #tree/as-cognition

Thc fruits whosc secds we dcpositccl will be
growing amidst a !arge variety of self-propagating hcrbs ancl trees.   The fruit
trees will mature as part of a forest. s.177
#tree/as-harmony #tree/as-nature #tree/is-fruit

 I've followecl the Meratus idiom
above to speak of "self-propagating herbs and trees" although nonhuman
anirnals, wind, and other agents may be rcquired to propagate these plants.
Yct it seems a useful enough way to distingi:1ish thc h.uman-plantcd and thc
merely human-encountered herb or tree. s.177
#tree/as-nature 

 Like orang·utans, civets,
wild pigs, and bats, lmmans have becomc onc of the ways fruit trees, in all
their variety, distribute their seeds. Fruit tree biodiversity is maintainecl in
part by those human-fruit tree interactions that fall somewhere in the gap
between cultivation and the wild. s.178
#tree/as-entangled #tree/is-fruit

 In the Meratus Mountains, only fruits still hanging
on thc tree are the exclusive property of tree claimants.  s.178
#tree/as-property #tree/is-fruit

J)urian is such a well-1.oved fruit that most trces in the Meratus Mountains
arc clairned. Thosc who plant a tree, and their dcscendants, claim it.1 'lhosc
who find a self-seeding· tree and watch and nurture it can also claim it.  Trees
can also bccomc unclaimcd, usually whcn the claimauts leave the area and
stop paying enough attention to thc tree to lmow its uncvcn fruiting sched­
ule. In this state, another person can claim the trec, or ncighbors who know
and watch it rnay share its fruits.  s.179

 Thcy
rangc from the sour bmnbawang, rarely deliberatcly planted but much cn­
joyed as a trailside snack, to the strongly scented binjai, mainly known as a
planted and tended tree.  s.179
#tree/protege

 A more relevant species is tarap (A. elastica), a
great forest tree only rarely deliberately planted bccause it is rarely in short
supply. s.180
#tree/is-tarap

Unlike their European cousins, they do not nest inside a closed
space; instcad, they hang tl1eir combs in a wcll-lig-hted space uncler a high
tree branch.  s.181
#tree/as-infrastructure #tree/is-honey

The building ofcombs does not, as far as I can
teil, damage tl1e tree in any way. llnt these u·ees are often covered with vines
and epiphytes, nnd their architccturally best branches may be blockcd by
competing smaller growth. Meratus prepare potential h011ey trces (liuuh) for
the bees, cleaning off competing vegetation.  s.181
#tree/as-savage #tree/as-protege #tree/is-honey

Meratus say that bees will
not come back to a tree that has not been cared for. s.182
#tree/as-protege #tree/is-honey

Meratus know which trees make goo<l honey trecs. Mrmgaris, Koompassi11
excelsa, is thc tallest trec of the Bornean rainforest, recorded to grow ovcr
260 feet; it is also the most popular of all trees for the bees, anl in many
other Dayak languages across Borneo is known by the local word for "honey
tree." Mangaris oftcn host more than fifty colonies in a good bce season.
Binuang (Octorneles sumatrttna), another huge tree whose circumference may
exceed mangaris, is also a good honey tree. So are a number of kinds of
damar, the dipterocarps that dominate the Bornean rainforest. Other honey
trees of the central mountains include alarrm (another <lipterocarp),
salang'ai, tampuruyung, pulayi (Alrtonia sp.), mampiring (Agathis ((/brt),jalamu,
haru wilas (Ficus sp.) and occ::isionally lua' (Ficus sp.), kupang, m[jfllungan,
krts1ti (Ponzetia pinntttfl), tikus,jttlanut, simuntm, and anglai. s.181

A three-species rclationship is set up
among bees, honey trees, and people. People encourage comb-building by
preparing the trees. s.182

They sang the sweet goodnight note of the lingut, a

 Nonaromatic resins are sometimes on the markct, sometimes off: the
damar resins of the great emergent dipterocarp trees, classified commcr­
cially as "white," "black," "cat's eye," "stone," s.183

blowpipc poison, for example, is called ra­
tumn, "lumdreds," to acknowledge the large number of ipuh trees (Antit1ris
toxicana and others) whose latex is combincd to produce the poison. s.183
#tree/is-ipub #tree/as-supplier

In familiar forest, one knows where
the traps are.) Familiar territories inspire an alertness in one's own "homc"
spaces: Which tree species are flowering? Which holes in the creek cuntain
edible minnows? Which animal tracks have been sig-hted? Which honey
trees are bcing smothered by strang·ling vines? s.186
#tree/is-honey #tree/as-cognition

There was already a variety of
young secondary forest trees, such as the gang-ly groun<l-figs, dmulali, with
thcir juicy red fruits pccking from the ground.  On one margin, pcople had
maintained a small clearing next to thc trail, and a few papaya trees from thc
ok! swidden still stood.  s.189

When l visited the sarne place in 1994, the trees were substantial, and, de­
spite my clear mcmorics of bends and rocks in the st"remn that runs along
one border, 1 had trouhle picking the area out from surrournling· forest. s.189
#tree/as-cognition #tree/as-history

I have said, some large trees, such as fruit ancl honey trees, are savecl in the
process of swidden-making. These will continue to form elemcnts of the
new forcst that grows on the site. Somc other trees, too, do not die in the
process of swiclden-making.  s.190

. Hik.ing with Mera11.1s
friends through familiar forest, we pauscd and mcandered cont.inually to
check the status of fruit trees and taste locally abundant snacks. In contrast,
walking throngh forest associated with a group with whom my friends did
not have closc relationships, wc moved along thc trail at a busincsslike pace,
only rarely stopping to drink or rest. s.192
#tree/as-fruit #tree/as-cognition #tree/as-home

 They are
usecl to fields in permanent cultivation, fields that are "obviously" sources of
human livelihood. W hethcr t:hey sec forests as sources of commercial timber
or genetic reserves, they arc likely to focus only on the completcd mosaic of
trees, not the process of landscape formation over time. From this snapshot
perspective, the diffcrence betwecn a neatly �ult.ivated field and a wild forest
is visually sharp. Everything· between is matter out of placc. s.193
#tree/as-abstract #tree/as-industry #tree/as-cognition

Local
rights over forested lands were written out of existence. Lots of areas with­
out trees wcre mapped as "forests"; many towns and villagcs wcrc included.14 s.194

 These
people have some of their farniliar forests along the Ayuh stream. Familiar
forests are always in process, changing· as ncw trees are planted and claimed
 'new routes for forcst collection found, new swidclcns cut and old ones cased
back into forest s.196
#tree/as-sustenance

The forest is full of the markings of past communities, and these are also
potential communities. An island of fruit trees in the forest marks a past
swidden duster. s.198
#tree/as-cognition #tree/is-fruit

 For example, even planted Meratus trees of any
stature have multiple claimants: the desccndants, male and femalc, of thc
original planter.  s.200
#tree/is-meratus #tree/as-claim #tree/as-protege

 Many big trees also have names,
that is, not only names for the kind of tree but also individual, personal
names. Hillsidcs are commonly rcfcrred to in relation to the namc of a big
tree s.200

 During that time,
Kodeco has logged most of the east side ofthe Meratus Mountains, creating
the frontier described in chapter 1. The ecological results have been dra­
matic, ranging from total loss of tree cover, to its replacement with mono­
crop plantations, to the skimpy residual forests that were so badly burned in
the great fires of 1997. s. 210

 The reforestation fund was a tax established on
commercial Jogging and intended to support tree planting and managernent.
lt was espccially bold for activists to objcct at this momcnt, bccause the gov­

The woman t:elling the story clrives
 the mcssage homc. "Whcn they came to cut down the forest," she says, "th

As I discussed in chapter 5,
groves of fruit trees, some carefully planted and some sprouting from dis­
carded seeds, develop around settlement sites; even when people move away,
these groves remain as markers of a community that may re-form in the fi1-
ture on the basis of its ong·oing, tree-made memories. Most peoplc maintain
allegiances not only to the groves and neighhors of their current locations
but also to older groves and past neighbors, with whom they may live again. s.257

 Collective
harvests of fruits, honey, an<l starch, in contrast, gather frien<ls and neigh­
bors who may or may not be kin, and who comc to the basc of thc tree fol­
lowing the tree claimants who announce the harvest. These trees, and the
charismatic individuals who draw harvesters to their bases, become social as
weil as geographic focal points in group formation. s.257
