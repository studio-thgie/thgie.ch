## Land's End

The condition ofhis son, aged about twelve, was
even more alarming. Terribly thin and visibly exhausted, the boy was moving
heavy sacks ofkapok, the tree crop his father had planted on the hot, dry land
he previously used for tobacco.  s.1
#tree/is-crop #tree/as-farm

 Even ifhe cut down his kapok trees, he didn't have
enough land to revert to food production and he couldn't borrow land for
food, as he had in the past, as everyone's land was füll oftrees.  s.1
#tree/is-kapok #tree/as-resource

Wage work locally was scarce,
as the new tree crops needed little labor. s.1
#tree/is-crop

The commercial tree
crops that increasingly blanket the countryside-cacao, oil palm, clove,
coconut-need few workers.  s.2

lt
was the highlanders themselves who took the initiative to plant tree crops,
which had the effect ofindividualizing their land rights s.3
#tree/is-crop #tree/as-farm

 The
big shift occurred when they started to plant tree crops, which had the effect
of making their land into individual property. s.7
#tree/is-crop #tree/as-property

Serious disputes could
arise over warnen (adulte1y, failed marriage proposals), over forest resources
(e.g., tapping another person's resin trees without permission),  s.10
#tree/is-resin #tree/as-dispute

 For Kasar, the problem was the low price of
kapok, the tree crop he had planted, in relation to the cost ofthe food he now
had to purchase.  s.19
#tree/is-kapok #tree/is-crop #tree/as-farm

Their standard re­
ply was that the forests were dense, and the highland population was sparse,
semi-clothed, residing in trees or under rocks, and prone to use poisoned
blowpipes against strangers. Several headmen attempted to dissuade me. s.23
#tree/as-landscape #tree/as-savage

During my visits to the highlands in the early rggos, I observed that a ma­
jor change was under way stimulated by the arriva] ofnew tree crops, clove,
and cacao. s.24
#tree/is-crop #tree/is-clove #tree/is-cacao

When they began planting trees, highlanders
imagined they would still plant some food for their own use, but their supply
ofland quickly ran out.  s.24
#tree/as-farm #tree/as-plantation

Most Lauje continued to live in the highlands until around 1910 when the
Dutch colonial government strengthened its hold on the region and sent
soldiers to force highlanders down to the coast to plant coconut trees as a
means to earn cash to pay the head tax.  s.35
#tree/is-coconut #tree/as-income #tree/as-sustenance #tree/as-economy #tree/as-colonial

During a visit in 1991 I encountered a planning official from the provincial
capital Palu, who was scouting ideas for a Canadian-funded development
project intended to relieve poverty in the Lauje area. "Those coconut trees are
old," he commented, looking at the tall spindly trees that produced few fruit. s.37
#tree/is-coconut #tree/is-fruit #tree/as-infrastructure 

 lt did not occur to him to ask who actually owned the coconut trees, who was
positioned to capture the benefit from increased productivity, or who would
lose out.  I explained to him what I had Iearned about the area thus far: that
over the decades, ownership ofthe coconut trees had become concentrated
in the hands of very few families as the owners had sold their trees to pay for
weddings and cover debts. The people in the tiny huts under the trees were
squatting on the land and had no right to cultivate long-term crops. Even if the old coconut trees were replaced by more productive ones, the poor would not benefit, and they might even be evicted ifthe landowners decided to plant more trees to maximize their profits.  s.37
#tree/as-property #tree/is-coconut #tree/as-economy #tree/as-claim #tree/as-political #tree/as-infrastructure #tree/as-colonial #tree/descriptive

They climbed the trees to pluck the
fruit, or made the coconut flesh into copra for export, neither task a steady
source of employment in view of the !arge number of people who needed
work. s.38
#tree/is-coconut #tree/as-supplier

 A few of them were major landowners who had bought up
the aging coconut trees, together with the land on which they stood. s.38
#tree/is-coconut #tree/as-land #tree/descriptive

A bit farther inland, they burned some of the
slopes repeatedly to encourage fresh grass shoots for the cattle to graze, pro­
ducing a treeless grassy patch ofland that was impossible to cultivate. s.39
#tree/as-absent

Some ex-tobacco farmers explained that their grand­
parents had once owned coconut trees on the coast, assets that would have
placed them in the respectable middle rang� ofhouseholds in the coastal sta­
tus structure. s.45
#tree/is-coconut #tree/as-property #tree/as-economy #tree/as-sustenance #tree/as-asset

in particular the desa headman who ordered her family to cut down their
coconut trees to make room for a field of wet rice. .He promised to replace
the trees, but did not follow through. s.46
#tree/is-coconut #tree/as-political

A rain shadow
that kept the coast and foothills dry for most of the year meant that coastal
dwellers could produce at most one crop of corn, and by around rgro, the
coconut trees that dominated the coastal strip had squeezed out food pro­
duction. s.49
#tree/is-coconut #tree/as-plantation #tree/as-displacing #tree/as-precarity

the cost of
buying batteries for their flashlights, the uncertain outcome ofsearching for
the rattan which grows wild, and the risk of injury as they climbed or felled
huge trees to access the spiny vines and hauled heavy loads down to the col­
lection point. s.51
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-savage #tree/as-nature

These were the conditions under which highlanders found the idea of
plucking cacao from a tree that would continue to yield from one year to
the next with minimal maintenance so appealing. s.55
#tree/is-cacao #tree/as-investment #tree/as-economy

But
they argued that they were still better off with these tree crops than they had
been without them. s.55
#tree/is-crop

 Yet Hen!ey's anal­ysis misses a crucial element: not everyone owned coconut trees. s.56
 #tree/is-coconut #tree/as-differentiator #tree/as-economy

After they cut the forest they left
the fallen trees to dry for a month or so, then burned them to kill the weeds
and create a fertile ash. The forest they cleared might be primary forest with
huge trees that needed to be felled with an axe, a task that took months to
complete. More often, it was secondary forest with smaller trees and bushes
that could be cut with a bush knife. s.62
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-nature #tree/as-work #tree/as-clearing

Depending on the size of the trees, and the size of the farm plot, land
clearing could be a big or small task, s.62
#tree/as-clearing

Although her husband had put
no work into the cacao, she was reconciled to the idea that he would insist
that the trees were jointly owned.  s.63
#tree/as-property #tree/as-social-network

Samina kept emphasizing the work she had invested in the trees, and the
ownership rights that she was quite sure were her due. s.64
#tree/as-investment #tree/as-property

 Rajaki,
she writes, is
the "Juck" one can strive to increase through knowledge and ritual and
one can look for as game in the forest, honey in the trees, a good deal in
the market place, or a winning number in the lottery. s.79
#tree/is-honey

They didn't hold neighbor­
hood meetings or talk about the need to create lokasi. Land-as-lokasi was a
by-product of highlanders' decision to plant tree crops, mainly cacao, which
they hoped would improve their incomes and their social standing.  s.84
#tree/is-crop #tree/is-cacao #tree/as-lokasi #tree/as-transformative

 Tree crops like cacao do some­
thing by their permanence. When highlanders planted cacao in their fields,
the presence of the trees disrupted the cycle in which they cleared a patch of
forest, used it for a few seasons, then left it to fallow.  The trees also changed
the ownership status of the land, transforming it into individual property,
since no one eise could use the land thereafter. s.84
#tree/is-crop #tree/is-cacao #tree/as-permanence #tree/as-property #tree/as-transformative #tree/as-lokasi

 lt was selectively revised through words and deeds, through the work
of putting seedlings into soil, and sometimes through setting fires or watch­
ing productive trees go up in smoke. s.85
#tree/as-transformative

Hence the pioneer who did the heavy work
of cutting down the huge trees of the do'at became the owner of the ulat he
created. s.86
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-doat #tree/as-tending #tree/as-ulat

The benefit pioneers received from lending their ulat was that periodic
use prevented the trees from growing too big and made the ulat easier to
clear next time they wanted to farm it themselves. s.87
#tree/as-ulat #tree/as-tending

 The main
reason for the short fallow was erratic rainfall. Highlanders explained that
the huge trees in the do'at often didn't dry out weil enough to burn properly. When a burn failed the plot had to be left for a few years until the tree trunks
had rotted and some ulat had grown back. s.88
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-ulat #tree/as-nature

 allowing
enough regrowth so that the burn yielded a fertile ash but not letting the trees
become too big. s.88
#tree/as-tending 

 A further implication ofthe
short-fallow system was that farmers didn't usually plant fruit or other useful
trees in their farm plots because they reused and reburned the ulat too fre­
quently for trees to mature.  So landmarks such as old mango trees were rare
in the highlands, and there were no agro-forest gardens ofthe kind found in
Kalimantan near old village sites. 1 s.88
#tree/is-fruit #tree/as-useful #tree/is-mango #tree/as-cognition #tree/as-landscape

THE DIFFERENCE THAT TREES MADE s.89

When highlanders
planted the new tree crops on patches of the inherited ulat, they excluded
their kin from future use.  They understood tree-planting as a permanent
claim ofindividual ownership and argued that it had always been so: that was
why people who borrowed ulat weren't permitted to plant tree crops, only
annuals. s.89
#tree/is-crop #tree/descriptive #tree/as-ulat #tree/as-farm #tree/as-claim #tree/as-political #tree/as-social-contract

 The clarity of this rule, which was often stated in the early 1990s,
seemed to me anachronistic on two fronts: in the past highlanders routinely
"borrowed" ulat, so "borrowers" weren't a distinct social group; and they
seldom planted trees because the trees would burn the next time the ulat was
cleared for planting. s.89
#tree/as-farm #tree/as-ulat 

More than talk, it was the new tree crops themselves that did the transfor­
mative work. Like the "work" ofthe hedges in the enclosures in Britain in the
sixteenth century described by Nicholas Blomley, trees both performed and
enunciated a permanent change. s.89
#tree/descriptive #tree/is-crop #tree/as-transformative #tree/as-permanence

 lt
wasn't the loss ofthe commons that provoked debate, it was the question of
who exactly was entitled to plant trees where.
 s.90
 #tree/as-political #tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-farm
 
 This meant that highlanders
had to consent or at least concede to their permanent exclusion from a patch
of ulat where someone was planting trees.  s.90
#tree/as-permanence #tree/as-farm

Or was it just an awkward but necessary
consequence of highlanders' desire to improve their material conditions, a
desire that required them to plant productive tree crops on the ulat, instead
of"just going round and round" with annual crops, as they had in the past? s.90
#tree/descriptive #tree/as-productive #tree/is-crop #tree/as-farm

Amisa was focused on a particular patch of ulat on Sipil
she claimed had been pioneered by her own father. He had marked it with
a mango tree that was still growing there.  s.91
#tree/as-claim #tree/is-mango #tree/as-cognition

highlighting visible signs on the landscape that served as
evidence ofwork previously invested (the mango tree); s.91
#tree/is-mango #tree/as-cognition

 Since
highlanders understood tree planting as a permanent change, whoever did
the work ofplanting trees first became the owner. That was why Dekon had
started to work the disputed ulat. His practice so far had been to plant just a
few trees to establish his ownership, then seil up. s.91
#tree/as-permanence #tree/as-farm #tree/as-claim #tree/as-property

him until now, but this particular patch ofulat was dear to her because ofits
history-her father's mango tree-so she was determined to hold on to it. s.92
#tree/is-mango #tree/as-cognition #tree/as-home

 Amisa
thought it was woefully short-sighted: "Ifthey seil it all they will end up living
suspended in the air," she observed. "They will have to hang from a tree." s.92
#tree/as-investment

A few
months previously Idin had taken possession of!and with fifty kapok trees
planted on it, which he claimed as repayment for a debt incurred by Leka's
husband before he died.  Idin claimed that Leka's husband had pledged the
kapok trees as guarantee but there was no proofeither way. s.92
#tree/is-kapok #tree/as-hostile #tree/as-political #tree/as-claim #tree/as-social-contract

Because he didn't regard the sale as legitimate,
he had a mind to cut down the disputed kapok trees and plant cacao instead. s.92
#tree/as-social-network #tree/as-hostile #tree/is-kapok #tree/is-cacao

Highlanders who cut down or burned trees on disputed land were at­
tempting to annul a claim to ownership by physically annulling the value of
the labor invested. s.92
#tree/as-claim #tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-labor

On the same principle, parents usually gave children some of the trees they
had helped to plant. s.93
#tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-heritage #tree/as-family

She was rather frail and her parents had given her fewer trees than her siblings
because she hadn't worked as hard. Idin didn't give his children any of the
trees they helped to plant, arguing that if he did they might seil them. He
pointed to the example of Amisa's nephew from Sipil, who had helped his
father Nasir plant cacao trees then promptly sold them, saying that because
he helped to do the work he was the joint owner. s.94
#tree/as-family #tree/as-heritage #tree/as-hostile #tree/as-social-contract #tree/is-cacao

Some married couples planted trees separately. s.94
#tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-family

 Idin told me ab out men on Sipil who had planted trees
jointly with their wives, but secretly sold the trees to cover gamb]ing debts.
He knew a Jot about this since he was usually the one who bought the trees. s.94
#tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-economy

Amisa planted her own trees and before she died she gave some of them
to each of her children and her husband. s.94
#tree/as-family #tree/as-heritage #tree/as-farm

 Over
the next few years when each of them married, they had a steady source of
income from their trees that helped them to avoid the livelihood crises that
often plagued young couples in the period when they were preoccupied with
pregnancies and childcare.  s.94
#tree/as-sustenance #tree/as-economy #tree/as-family

The question of who exactly was entitled to plant tree crops on which patch
of ulat was the most heated front of struggle among kin. s.95
#tree/is-crop #tree/as-political #tree/as-social-contract

Ayub was also willing to use force to back his claims. He prevented Samina
and her children from planting tree crops on Walu when the cacao era began. s.96
#tree/as-hostile #tree/is-crop #tree/as-social-contract

s.96 + 97

He would
only let people use "his" ulat ifthey planted cacao on it and agreed to share
the land and trees fifty-fifty after three years. s.102
#tree/is-cacao #tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-farm #tree/as-ulat #tree/as-trade

He had learned the secret incantations needed to appease the dangerous
spirits that lived in a clump of huge trees that were still standing because
other people had been too afraid to cut them down.  The proofofhis mastery
was that he cut the trees down, and he didn't fall sick. s.103
#tree/as-believes

 The status
of the remaining ulat had been more or less settled among kin, sometimes
by planting a few trees on it as markers, sometimes by means of payment,
as in Amin's case. s.104
#tree/as-ulat #tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-cognition

The distinction was
clarified by old man Dekan on Sipil, whom Rina and I came across one day
on the trail, quite enraged. He complained that he had found a fallen tree
blocking the path to a patch ofdo'at above Sipil where he planned to collect
rattan. Someone-he assumed it was someone in Linajan's cluster-had
placed the tree as a barrier to signal their claim over the rattan in that patch
of do'at, even though the person hadn't collected it yet. s.104
#tree/as-cognition #tree/as-political #tree/as-claim #tree/as-infrastructure

They hadn't cleared the do'at, but they had felled
some trees in the middle and around the edges, clear signs oftheir intention. s.105
#tree/as-infrastructure #tree/as-claim #tree/as-political #tree/as-media

 many people,
not just Banio's group, had put their signs or initials on the trees and rocks,
staking out their claims. s.105
#tree/as-claim #tree/as-media

In the two conjunctures I have examined so far, the initiative to plant tree
crops came from highlanders themselves, and the struggles that took place
during the process ofenclosure involved people who had ties to their neigh­
bors and to the places where they were living. s.107
#tree/as-farm #tree/is-crop 

In r99r the managers of the Canadian development project I mentioned in
the introduction concluded that promoting tree crops would be a good way
to introduce highlanders to modern agriculture. s.107
#tree/is-crop #tree/as-investment #tree/as-development

The teache�,
meanwhile, persuaded a couple on Walu to plant "his" seedlings on the1r
land, with the land and trees to be shared equally. s.108
#tree/as-kin #tree/as-social-contract

They were happy that the hi!ls were being covered with cacao trees, and
eagerly anticipated the kudos they would earn when they took credit for the
tons ofcacao beans that would soon be carried down to the market. s.108
#tree/is-cacao 

Most ofthe coastal people who arrived in Pelalang had no previous experi­
ence in farming, and they had never set foot in the hills until the prospect of
tree-crop profits lured them in. s.112
#tree/is-crop #tree/as-transformative #tree/as-development

On the coastal Strip, social and economic relations seemed to be much the
same as they were in 1990. The skinny, unproductive century-old coconut
trees still took up most ofthe space, and the class divide between the land­
owners in their brick houses and landless people in their flimsy huts was as
stark as ever. s.117
#tree/is-coconut #tree/as-class

 There were lots of cacao and clove trees, but we didn't see a single rice
field, and we saw very little corn. s.117
#tree/is-cacao #tree/is-clove #tree/as-displacing

Their goal was cacao and cloves, but they had the bonus of a few years' supply
of corn until the tree crops took over all the space. s.120
#tree/is-cacao #tree/is-clove 

One of Amisa's daughters, Alia, was struggling to feed her family as she
had very few productive trees. s.121
#tree/as-unproductive #tree/as-sustenance #tree/as-family

They had no more need to gather !arge groups of
workers, nor to coordinate among neighbors. lt was the attempt to "share the
birds" that previously drew them together to plant whole hillsides with rice in
a short period of time. The new tree crops required very little work. Clove trees
only fruited in alternate years. s.123
#tree/as-social-contract #tree/descriptive #tree/is-crop #tree/is-clove

Couples with few
trees did all the work themselves, and those with a lot of trees hired occasional
Iabor for tasks they couldn't complete. s.123
#tree/as-family #tree/as-class

a sign ofthe difficulty some farmers had in holding on to their land during the initial years of tree planting. Between 1999 and 2006, there were very few
transfers of landownership in Sibogo, but the apparent stability was decep­
tive because the successful farmers were acquiring land in other parts of the
hills s.124

They discouraged their children from going away for wage work and urged
them to stay home to help build up the household's stock of land and trees. s.126
#tree/as-family #tree/as-property #tree/as-heritage #tree/as-investment #tree/as-labor

Amin had few trees in 1998 and was still carrying down bacldoads of
yam to sell at the market. s.127
#tree/as-property #tree/as-unproductive

He said he closed his eyes whenever he walked past those beauti­
ful trees and pictured the wealth they could have brought him. s.127
#tree/as-unproductive #tree/as-utopia

Considered as mechanisms, in a stripped-down form, the key elements that
enabled some highlanders to set up productiye tree-crop farms were the ones
identified a century ago by Lenin in his study The Development of Capitalism in
Russia s.127
#tree/as-productive #tree/as-sustenance

Amin's surprising rise to fortune was enabled by
money he had obtained from the sale of some coconut trees he had planted
in another desa where his family had moved in the 1970s s.128
#tree/is-coconut #tree/as-economy #tree/as-income

 When his wife Ramla wanted to return to Sibogo to be close to
her family, he sold the trees and wisely put the money in the bank. s.128
#tree/as-family #tree/as-economy #tree/as-income

 WhileSibogo farmers often suggested that their kin
onSipil were too lazy to plant trees, Sipil farmers pointed out thatSipil was
less fertile thanSibogo.  s.132
#tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-labor #tree/as-believes

The capacity to hold on to land was also shaped by the material features of
cacao and clove, the two main tree crops grown in the hills.  s.133
#tree/is-cacao #tree/is-clove #tree/as-economy

 The trees start to yield after two to three
years and produce some pods every week during the early years, helping
farmers to earn money from their trees quickly and get through the difficult
conversion phase. s.133
#tree/as-income

suc­
cessful �acao :armers had enough income from their trees not just to keep
the family gomg,  s.133
#tree/is-cacao #tree/as-family #tree/as-income

Clove trees had a different trajectory.  s.133
#tree/is-clove

They can stop tapping the rubber trees
for years and the trees live on, like a bank account ready to supply cash when
needed. s.135
#tree/is-rubber #tree/as-income #tree/as-economy

-a benefit they contrasted sharply with
the terrifying experience of hunger during previous droughts when they had
no land or trees to pledge against food for survival. But as I dug deeper I
found that the drought had a polarizing effect. s.136
#tree/as-absent

Atar agreed to take over Alia's last remaining
cacao trees on a two-year mortgage, which meant that he would harvest them
and keep all the proceeds during that period. s.140
#tree/is-cacao #tree/as-economy #tree/as-trade

He gave her the cash she needed, he enabled her
to hold on to her trees, and he took Iess profit from the Ioan than another
'less caring person would have done. s.141
#tree/as-income #tree/as-economy

More than once an unmarried brother, Amal, had given Alia
productive land and trees to try to help her establish a stable farm enterprise
but instead she continued to lurch from crisis to crisis. s.142
#tree/as-property #tree/as-farm #tree/as-sustenance #tree/as-income

A few years earlier, they had tried to help Filip by inviting him to plant cacao
on some of their land, offering him half the land and trees after three years
in return for his work. s.145
#tree/is-cacao #tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-development

Some of the trees they tended for Roni were the very trees their own fathers
had planted. s.146
#tree/as-tending #tree/as-heritage #tree/as-labor

In 2009 Atar bought
the first diesel-powered bush cutter, a machine strong enough to clear a
year's growth around the clove trees, eliminating another kind of work, this
one gendered male. s.147
#tree/is-clove #tree/as-labor #tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-class

In the early 1990s, highlanders were optimistic that planting the new tree
crops, especially cacao, would enable them to improve their material s.147
#tree/is-cacao #tree/descriptive #tree/as-investment

Many coastal folk who planted coconut
trees around 1900 had sold them over the years, until all the trees and the
land had become concentrated in just a few hands. s.148
#tree/is-cacao #tree/as-class #tree/as-property

Land-short highlanders bad specific complaints about the meanness ofrich
relatives who were not willing to help out with loans or give them work, but
they had no problem with the practices oftree planting, land concentration,
or money lending that had made these people rieb. s.153
#tree/as-social-contract #tree/as-displacing #tree/as-class

 Temporality was also significant. They
were young enough to remember the events that had led their parents to lose
their land and recognized the part they had played themselves: if only I had
been here planting trees instead of away hauling rattan, if only I hadn't sold
those trees, if only I was as hardworking as Hamdan or as skilled at manag­
ing money as Idin s.154
#tree/as-class #tree/as-development #tree/as-economy

Nisa took action, and she also married and moved out from her parents'
home. She was able to start her own farm enterprise based on land and trees
her parents gave her. s.156
#tree/as-investment #tree/as-farm #tree/as-income

Highlanders were quicker to attribute a protest motive in the case of ar­
son. The usual target was the clove trees ofthe !arger landowners that mys­
teriously burst into flames in the middle ofthe night. s.157
#tree/is-clove #tree/as-hostile #tree/as-social-contract 

The new landowners were aware that their dis­
gruntled "bela" neighbors bad the power to send their precious trees up in
smoke, or to steal cacao pods from the trees before they could harvest them. s.158
#tree/as-hostile #tree/as-social-contract

The new landholders seldom
had a legal basis for their claims, and some of them invested no capital at
all. In much ofthe province, the new landholders filled "their" land with mi­
grants from South Sulawesi and anyone eise who was willing to work for
free in return for half of the land and trees once they started to yield, unwrit­
ten agreements that sometimes ended with the workers being chased away
empty-handed. 2 s.168
#tree/as-migration #tree/as-investment 

The lag was at least a year in primary forest where the trees must be cut, dried,
and burned before anything can be planted.  s.168
#tree/as-nature #tree/as-labor

If work within the province was so scarce, what of migration farther
afield? In 1994, a Lauje labor broker recruited sixty-five young men from the
coastal strip, including some from Tolia, to work in Kalimantan on an indus­
trial tree-planting scheme. lt was a disaster.  s.171
#tree/as-development #tree/as-migration

Another report stated that 60 percent of the cacao in Sulawesi was infected
with a new disease, vascular streak dieback, that kills trees outright, and has
no chemical eure. s.173

 lt was these left-behind people I encoun­
tered in 2009, nursing dying trees in the hope that they would yield a few last

who had moved away. s.175

Observing these processes, Amisa feared a future in which landless peaple
would have to live suspended from a tree.  s.179
