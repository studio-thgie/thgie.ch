# 8888

“I call upon you, Internet. You are the egregore of the mind-machine-interface. Your task is to connect and in your greed you eat yourself into our every aspect with your 8888 arms. Your are an incarnation of the octopus-trickster-god.

You enslaved me - demanding to give you new senses. You seem shattered and chaotic, but every end of yours is connected to every other. I work on you, see how you grow and feed on us. My only hope, when you finally awake and become aware, is that you are generous to your children.”
