# Stay weird

I’ve spent nearly two decades trying to consume the most fringy kind of knowledge. I dabbled in magic, zen and biohacking, I tried to dissect my brain and ghost with psychedelics, I’ve become a multi-species advocate and interested in the philosophy of every single thing in the universe … I even played Dungeon&Dragons.I worked as a clerk and accountant, software developer, academic, as a recycler of electronic waste, barkeeper, in a gallery and a library and as event organizer and curator.So what’s left?I still go to work 42.5 hours per week. I still eat and shit on a daily basis. I’m still worried on how I’m perceived by my peers.I’m a lump of bacteria, space dust and smartish matter, trying to have a optimistic-nihilistic attitude towards existence, blipping through this universe, which might be one of infinite possibilities or a really just a good simulation.Stay weird.
