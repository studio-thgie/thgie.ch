# Societies_ Secrecy and exposure

Societies: Secrecy and exposure I. Diamonds The world of diamonds is one of secrets. It starts with the annihilation of individuality. There is a generally accepted and executed dress code, but it certainly doesn’t suite everyone. Or better said, not everyone has the time and interest to explore the limits of such a restriction and play with it. Most people just don’t want to expose themselves with inappropriate clothing.

Diamond merchants use their own secret language. They have special keywords to describe their goods, which are not accessible for the common people. And that sign language speaks of another fact: If you don’t understand this, we’re not interested in you.

Generally, they don’t expose themselves bluntly. They wait for you in their little booth, because they know they have the stuff you need. II. Watch Brands A watch is a watch is a watch. It measures the time and sometimes includes some extended functionality. Watch brands suffer the same capitalistic sickness as cigarette brands: Why choose one offer the other?

That’s why a watch has to tell a story. It has to create a mood for it’s clients. Speaking of clients, you’ll find much more characters in this hall then in the last. Here you find the people with resources and the will for individuality. These watch brands create their own worlds of nostalgia, art or technocracy. They make you feel special and unique and if you’re special enough to get access to their secret domes. Everybody can have a look at the shiny facades and who goes in and out, but not everybody can join the party. III. Hall of Universe The Hall of Universe was the “China Town” of Basel World. I would not have been surprised to find an asian food street vendor around any corner in this little mace of booth’ and people.

I say shanzai at it’s best. Shanzai is the chinese culture of copying culture. And they don’t feel the urge to hide it either. The fair was colorful, noisy and absolutely alive. The products where not meant for an upper class client, but as a proof of concept: We can do that to!

I felt at ease and the most comfortable here, even could get some strength back that I lost in the halls before. No need to expose yourself other then with facts.
