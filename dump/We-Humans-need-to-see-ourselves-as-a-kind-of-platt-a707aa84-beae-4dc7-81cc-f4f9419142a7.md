# We Humans need to see ourselves as a kind of plattform

We Humans need to see ourselves as a kind of plattform to build upon, to experiment with. We need to enable people to directly work on themselves, on their body, their mind, their relationship to the background their embeded in. Recognize yourself as assemblage. As a construct conjured by multiple relations.
