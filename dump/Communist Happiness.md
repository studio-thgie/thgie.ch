# Communist Happiness

Communist Theory, Marx, proposed a progression of revolutions towards a better future. Thus all left vocabulary argues that after comes good and stays in a never ending fight.

Communist Theory puts itself in a higher moral position. But who are you to judge the ruling classes to be bad? Isn’t it quite logical to pursue the status quo and thus to oppress and exploit? And who am I to tell you who you are? This is the meaning of Hegels Dialectic. The difference that causes friction. Because that’s what we need in the end. Friction, which brings the new into the world, the new we can explore and test it to be less frictionous for all of us. All we want in our emergence is entropy.

But this is just on more abstraction and when the sun goes out and we are still on this earth no abstraction will be no more. Fatality. This is where logic and emotion are intertwined. Because we can feel happy and content. And is it thus not the most logical consequence to pursue those feelings? And is it not empirically shown, that the easiest way to achieve those feelings is together?
